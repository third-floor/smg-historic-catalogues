It is a single-observation, coincidence instrument, with a fixed base of 80 cm., and measures ranges between 200 and 2,000 yd. with a percentage error directly proportional to the distance. The instrument is optically equivalent to a pair of telescopes having a common central eye-piece and their axes in opposite directions along the base-line, at the ends of which are the two objective lenses. Two pencils of rays diverging from the distant object to each end of the instrument are reflected at right angles by mirrors so as to traverse the objectives and form two images at the centre, where they are again reflected at right angles by a pair of mirrors, one of which is parallel to each end mirror. The two images are thus viewed in the focal plane of the right eyepiece of the instrument, and are separated laterally by a distance inversely proportional to the required range. Between the right objective lens and the central mirrors there is a small angled deflecting prism, which can move along the axis, and in so doing increases or decreases the amount of separation of the two images. In one position of the prism, corresponding to the distance of the object, the two images coincide. A scale attached to the prism moves with it and is graduated so to give the range directly. This scale and its fixed index-line are viewed by the observer\u2019s left eye in a separate eyepiece, which also serves in conjunction with a field lens as a small telescope of large field for picking up the target.""], ""other"": [""Inv. 1914-180"", ""Lent by Messrs.
