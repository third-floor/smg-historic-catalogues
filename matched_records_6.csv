Date of creation: 1830
Object entry information: This instrument is a modification of the *thermomètre fronde* originally designed by Arago in 1830 for ascertaining the true temperature of the air without a thermometer screen. The thermometer is enclosed in its perforated metal case, when it is rapidly swung above the head about six times by means of a silk cord. The temperature indicated will then be found to be almost precisely that of a thermometer in a Stevenson screen. By this method more accurate results are obtainable than by exposure on stands of ordinary construction. (See Q. J. R. Met. Soc. 1877.)

Object entry information: This instrument was designed and used by Prof. Balfour Stewart in 1856 to measure the sum of the fluctuations of temperature. Advantage is taken of the difference of capillary force and friction in two tubes of different capacity connected with the same bulb. The thermometer, which consists of two tubes of different bores connected by a bulb in the centre, is set in a horizontal position, when an increase of tem- perature causes the mercury in the wider tube to move from the bulb towards the end, but with a decrease in temperature the mercury in the tube of narrower bore moves towards the bulb. Thus with all changes there is a movement of the mercury in the direction of the extremity of the wider tube, towards which the mercury steadily creeps. The instrument is fitted with a scale, divided into two parts, and graduated from 0 to 180, by means of which the amount of fluctu- ation during any interval of time can be ascertained. The thermometer is set for observation by standing it on end. (See Proc. Roy. Soc., Vol. VIII, 1856–7, p. 195.)

Maker/Donor: Lent by Prof. Balfour Stewart, F.R.S.
Date of creation: 1856
Object entry information: This instrument was designed and used by Prof. Balfour Stewart in 1856 to measure the sum of the fluctuations of temperature. Advantage is taken of the difference of capillary force and friction in two tubes of different capacity connected with the same bulb. The thermometer, which consists of two tubes of different bores connected by a bulb in the centre, is set in a horizontal position, when an increase of tem- perature causes the mercury in the wider tube to move from the bulb towards the end, but with a decrease in temperature the mercury in the tube of narrower bore moves towards the bulb. Thus with all changes there is a movement of the mercury in the direction of the extremity of the wider tube, towards which the mercury steadily creeps. The instrument is fitted with a scale, divided into two parts, and graduated from 0 to 180, by means of which the amount of fluctu- ation during any interval of time can be ascertained. The thermometer is set for observation by standing it on end. (See Proc. Roy. Soc., Vol. VIII, 1856–7, p. 195.)

Object name: SYMONS’S EARTH THERMOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by L. Casella, Esq.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This arrangement was designed by G. J. Symons to obviate the difficulties encountered in obtaining ground temperature at different depths.
It consists of a heavy iron tube pointed at its lower end and driven into the ground to the depth at which the temperature is to be measured, while its upper end projects about 6 in. above the surface of the ground. A slow action thermometer protected by a boxwood casing is suspended by a chain within the iron tube, and remains there until a reading is taken, which is done by momentarily raising the thermometer. The scale is graduated in degrees from 25° to 95° F.
In this way the earth temperature at any convenient depth may be measured, the depths most frequently employed being 6 in., 1 ft., 2 ft., 3 ft., 4 ft., 6 ft., and 10 ft.

Object entry information: This self-registering minimum thermometer is constructed on the principle proposed by Rutherford in 1794. This alcohol thermometer is used horizontally and a small glass index floats in the spirit, its end furthest from the bulb being flattened. The instrument is set by inclining it with the bulb uppermost, until the index reaches the meniscus of the indicating column, after which it is again placed in the horizontal position. Any subsequent decrease of temperature causes the index to be drawn back to the lowest point to which the alcohol recedes, but an increase of temperature has no effect, so that the end of the index remote from the bulb registers the minimum temperature which has been attained.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed and patented by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra in 1855, to indicate the minimum temperature attained since a prior observation was made. The large bulb of the thermometer is connected to a fine capillary tube, above which and continuous with it is a tube of wider bore, provided with a graduated scale and terminating at its upper end in a small bulb. A steel index pointed at both ends is free to move along the wider tube, and when set for observation its upper point is brought to the mercury level. With any contraction of the mercury column, the index falls by its own weight, but with increase of temperature the mercury expands and rises in the tube, passing the index and forcing it to the side of the tube, where it remains firmly fixed, and indicates the minimum temperature reached by the position of its upper point. A magnet serves to adjust the index, thereby setting the instrument for another observation. The scale is graduated in degrees from - 47° to 126° F. (See Pat. Specn., No. 2306 of 1855.)

Attached to the stem of the thermometer, and about an inch above the cylindrical bulb, is a supplementary tube, in which is inserted a small platinum plug. The thermometer is used horizontally, and if it is inclined the mercury flows along the supplementary tube until it reaches the plug. On a decrease of temperature the mercury will fall in the indicating column until it attains its minimum temperature, and on a subsequent increase of temperature the mercury will rise in the supplementary tube, so that the indicating column will continue to register the minimum temperature. To reset the instrument, the bulb end of the thermometer is raised until the mercury again comes in contact and is checked by the plug. (See Pat. Specn., No. 1223 of 1862.)

Object entry information: It is an ordinary mercury in glass thermometer, supported with its stem horizontal. About 1.5 in. from the bulb this horizontal stem is fitted with a lateral chamber, shouldered near its extremity, into which the mercury expands as the temperature rises, while the position of the mercury in the indicating stem remains stationary. Subsequent fall of temperature causes the mercury to recede in the stem, while that in the lateral chamber is unaffected. In this way the thermometer continually indicates the minimum temperature attained since it was last set. (See Pat. Specn., No. 2100 of 1861.)

Object entry information: In this form of instrument, which was introduced in 1861, the temperature is ascertained by the measurement of a detached portion of the mercurial column. In the bulb is a piece of platinum wire extending from a contraction at the neck to the bottom, and above the bulb is a small air bubble by which the column is divided. During a fall of temperature, mercury passes below the air bubble (when it is in its lowest position at the neck of the bulb) into the bulb, thus shortening the column; on the temperature rising, the air bubble is raised and carries along with it the detached column unaltered in length. To take a reading, the zero of the scale is brought into line with the upper part of the air bubble, when the number corresponding to the top of the upper column will give the minimum temperature.

Maker/Donor: Lent by S. G. Denton, Esq.
Date of creation: 1782
Object entry information: This instrument is a modification of the Six's thermometer of 1782, a thin flat bulb being fitted to increase its sensitiveness. The thermometer is identical in principle to the Six's thermometer shown adjacent. The large bulb is specially designed, however, so as to present as large a surface to the air as possible, thereby increasing the sensitiveness of the instrument and reducing its lag.

Maker/Donor: Made and lent by C. F. Casella & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This instrument is similar in principle to Six's instrument, but is constructed to hang horizontally instead of vertically. The tube is in the form of a U, having a bulb at each extremity, one being completely filled with spirit, and the other containing spirit and also a bubble of air under pressure. As the temperature rises, the liquid in the filled bulb expands and pushes in front of it a column of mercury, having an iron index at each end. As the temperature decreases the mercury is allowed to move back and pushes the lower index to the left. The indexes remain at the furthest point to which they are pushed by the mercury as it travels forwards or backwards, and thus indicate both maximum and minimum temperatures, the readings being taken from the ends of the indexes nearest the mercury. They are reset by tilting the instrument so that they fall by their own weight on to the mercury column.

Object entry information: same liquid and also containing a bubble of air under pressure. Mercury is contained in the lower half of the V-tube, and as the temperature rises, the liquid in the filled bulb expands and pushes in front of it the column of mercury at either end of which is a steel index coated with glass, which is enabled to retain its position in the tube by means of an attached hair. The index on the right is thus pushed upwards and remains at the extreme point to which it is pushed, the maximum temperature being then indicated by the position of its lower extremity. A subsequent fall of temperature moves the mercury column to the left, pushing the left hand index upwards, thus indicating the minimum temperature. The instrument is set for observation by adjusting the steel indexes to the ends of the mercury column by means of a magnet.

Object entry information: The mercurial maximum and spirit minimum thermometers, which were originally designed by Dr. Rutherford in 1794, are shown together on the same frame. The thermometers are mounted horizontally, the maximum one being uppermost and consisting of a mercury in glass instrument, provided with a steel index which is pushed along by the mercury column as the temperature rises. The minimum instrument is a spirit thermometer, provided with a glass index which recedes with the indicating column on a fall of temperature, but does not change its position when the temperature rises. This form of maximum thermometer is not now in common use, but the minimum thermometer is frequently employed. (See Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., 1794.)

Object entry information: A recording barometer was designed by Beaudoux in 1777, and consisted of a siphon barometer attached to a semi-circular balance beam carrying a pencil, which traced a continuous record on a travelling paper. This arrangement was modified in 1780 by Changeux, who arranged the recording pencil to be left free, and to be struck by a hammer at definite times, a method afterwards adopted by Kreil 1841, Brysson 1844, and others. The discovery of photography and the applications of electricity enabled Jordan in 1838 to apply photo-graphy to the registration of barometric and other variations, and he was followed in 1847 by Brooke and Ronalds working independently. The balance barometer, after having been employed by Morland, was revived by King in 1853 for recording purposes, and again by Secchi four years later. Regnard’s barometrograph of 1857 provided a continuous record by differential action originating from a clock or from electric currents, controlled by the movement of the float in the lower branch of a siphon barometer, by which means motion is communicated to a screw or a line passing over a pulley, in either case carrying a recording pencil.

Object entry information: This is a closed cistern barometer embodying the principle first suggested by Fortin about 1810, which consists in adjusting the mercury in the cistern until its surface is just in contact with a fixed ivory point. The graduations of this instrument are made from the tip of the ivory pointer in the cistern which indicates the zero of the scale, and before a reading is taken the surface of the mercury is brought into contact with this tip by means of a screw at the bottom of the barometer, which, acting on an inner flexible leather base of the cistern, raises or lowers the contents. The readings obtained in this way give the actual height of the mercury column from the surface of the mercury in the cistern, and the capacity error is thus eliminated. A metal scale and vernier enable this height to be read to 0·002 in., and a Fahrenheit thermometer on the case of the instrument indicates the temperature. A barometer tube is supported by a bracket and fitted with a ring and clamping screws, so that it may be fixed readily in a vertical position, which is essential for accurate observations.

Object entry information: This open cistern mercurial barometer, which dates from about 1820, was made for the Royal Society by Newman, under the direction of Dr. Daniell. This cistern is turned in well-seasoned mahogany, and there is a small cavity in its base to receive the end of the barometer tube, while a groove communicates with a cavity to ensure the free passage of the mercury. An ivory float with marked stem indicates the change of level of the mercury in the cistern with the rise or fall of the barometer, and by means of which the level may be taken very accurately. The tube has a large bore (0·53 in.), hence the error from capillarity is small, and the correction to be applied for the capacity of the cistern is 0·01 of the distance above or below the neutral point, which is given on the instrument as 30·576 in. A scale reading to 0·002 in. enables the barometric height to be read and reduced to the standard temperature of 32° F. A small thermometer in front of the instrument dips into the mercury of the cistern, and is graduated with the Réaumur and Fahrenheit scales. (See Meteorological Essays and Observations, by J. F.

Object entry information: This open cistern mercurial barometer, which dates from about 1820, was made for the Royal Society by Newman, under the direction of Dr. Daniell. This cistern is turned in well-seasoned mahogany, and there is a small cavity in its base to receive the end of the barometer tube, while a groove communicates with a cavity to ensure the free passage of the mercury. An ivory float with marked stem indicates the change of level of the mercury in the cistern with the rise or fall of the barometer, and by means of which the level may be taken very accurately. The tube has a large bore (0·53 in.), hence the error from capillarity is small, and the correction to be applied for the capacity of the cistern is 0·01 of the distance above or below the neutral point, which is given on the instrument as 30·576 in. A scale reading to 0·002 in. enables the barometric height to be read and reduced to the standard temperature of 32° F. A small thermometer in front of the instrument dips into the mercury of the cistern, and is graduated with the Réaumur and Fahrenheit scales. (See Meteorological Essays and Observations, by J. F.

Object entry information: This barometer was in use at the rooms of the Royal Society during the latter half of the eighteenth century, and is referred to by Cavendish in 1776 in his description of the Royal Society's instruments. The cistern consists of a turned mahogany hemisphere, provided with a cover. The barometer tube is secured with its lower end below the surface of the mercury in this chamber, while at the upper end a movable index carries a vernier by means of which the barometric height may be read on the graduated scale. The internal diameter of the tube is approximately 0·25 in., and the depression of the mercury due to capillarity is 0·05 in., while the limit of the capacity error is about 0·01 in. Seven weather indications are marked opposite the appropriate barometric readings. (See Phil. Trans., Vol. LXVI, 1776, p. 375.)

Object name: STANDARD FORTIN BAROMETER.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. Elliott Bros.
Date of creation: About 1810
Object entry information: This is a closed cistern barometer embodying the principle first suggested by Fortin about 1810, which consists in adjusting the mercury in the cistern until its surface is just in contact with a fixed ivory point. The graduations of this instrument are made from the tip of the ivory pointer in the cistern which indicates the zero of the scale, and before a reading is taken the surface of the mercury is brought into contact with this tip by means of a screw at the bottom of the barometer, which, acting on an inner flexible leather base of the cistern, raises or lowers the contents. The readings obtained in this way give the actual height of the mercury column from the surface of the mercury in the cistern, and the capacity error is thus eliminated. A metal scale and vernier enable this height to be read to 0·002 in., and a Fahrenheit thermometer on the case of the instrument indicates the temperature. A barometer tube is supported by a bracket and fitted with a ring and clamping screws, so that it may be fixed readily in a vertical position, which is essential for accurate observations.

Date of creation: 1876 (designed)
Object entry information: This instrument, which is similar in principle to those of Hall in 1851 and Rankine 1853, was designed by Mr. Stanley in 1876 in order to secure the mean of the atmospheric pressure for any given period, as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, by simple observations. In the chronobarometer, a barometer tube of modified construction is suspended as a pendulum, and driven as an ordinary time pendulum, by clockwork. The modification consists principally in making the vacuum chamber at the top and the cistern below of nearly equal diameters, so that increase of atmospheric pressure shall raise as great a weight as is necessary to shorten the radius of the centre of oscillation sufficiently for the clock to be accelerated considerably thereby. The clockwork is so constructed that the number of oscillations of the pendulums are continuously counted off on the dial, which reads decimally up to ten millions, and it is found that a rise of 1 in. of mercury in the barometer pendulum accelerates the clock about 949 beats per day. To ascertain the mean atmospheric pressure over a given period by this instrument, the time of observation at which the period commences must be taken by an ordinary clock simultaneously with the reading of the dial, as also at the end of the given period. Temperature correction is made by means of the temperature clock or chronothermometer shown adjacent. (See Q. J. R. Met. Soc., Vol. III, 1877, p. 352, and Vol. XII, 1886, p. 115.)

Object entry information: This apparatus was designed in 1903 by Sir Napier Shaw, F.R.S., and Mr. W. H. Dines, to secure a magnified record of the minor fluctuations of atmospheric pressure, and, at the same time, to disentangle these fluctuations from the general barometric surges. It consists of a closed metal cylinder, of about one-third of a cubic foot capacity, containing air at approximately atmospheric pressure, provided with a mechanical arrangement by which the variations of the difference of the pressures inside and out are recorded. In order that the temperature of this air may only change slowly, the cylinder is enclosed in a large wooden case, the intervening space being packed with feathers, or some other non-conducting material, while, in order that the pressure inside may not differ materially from that outside, a very small leak is allowed, through a fine capillary tube, which does not interfere with changes of short period, but prevents the pen from wandering from its mean position during a steady rise or fall of the barometer. A hollow cylindrical bell floats mouth downwards in a vessel containing mercury, and the interior of the bell communicates with the air chamber through a vertical pipe. Fairly rapid decrease of external pressure, or increase of internal pressure, causes the bell to rise, and the motion is magnified by a system of levers and communicated to the pen, which records on a chart rotated by clockwork.

Pressure variations which are too small to be seen in the float barogram are plainly discernible in the micro- barogram, while changes of pressure which are sufficiently large to appear in the former record assume considerably greater proportions in the latter, enabling the wave-form to be investigated.

Object entry information: This Kew Pattern Station barometer is in general use in the British Isles at the present time, and is used at all land stations under the control of the Meteorological Office. In this type of instrument the glass tube is considerably contracted for the greater portion of its length in order to prevent unsteadiness of the mercury column or ""pumping,"" also to strengthen the tube and to lessen the weight of mercury. The tube is enclosed in a metal case, which is mounted on gimbals to ensure verticality, and the upper part of the instrument carries a scale, graduated in millibars and inches, while a vernier enables the height to be read to 0.01 millibars or 0.002 in. The instrument also carries a thermometer, which is graduated to read temperature on the Fahrenheit scale from 5° F. to 130° F., and on the absolute scale from 253a to 328a. A small hole in the upper part of the cistern admits access to the super- incumbent air in the cistern, and a washer of leather permits the atmosphere to exert pressure, but prevents the mercury escaping from the cistern. To prevent air and moisture leaking into the vacuum above the mercury column, the tube is furnished with a small ""air-trap,"" or funnel, as suggested by Bunten in 1824, which is inserted between the cistern and the top of the mercury column. By this means, any air entering the tube becomes imprisoned at the trap, and therefore cannot interfere with the efficiency of the instrument.

Object entry information: This apparatus was designed in 1903 by Sir Napier Shaw, F.R.S., and Mr. W. H. Dines, to secure a magnified record of the minor fluctuations of atmospheric pressure, and, at the same time, to disentangle these fluctuations from the general barometric surges. It consists of a closed metal cylinder, of about one-third of a cubic foot capacity, containing air at approximately atmospheric pressure, provided with a mechanical arrangement by which the variations of the difference of the pressures inside and out are recorded. In order that the temperature of this air may only change slowly, the cylinder is enclosed in a large wooden case, the intervening space being packed with feathers, or some other non-conducting material, while, in order that the pressure inside may not differ materially from that outside, a very small leak is allowed, through a fine capillary tube, which does not interfere with changes of short period, but prevents the pen from wandering from its mean position during a steady rise or fall of the barometer. A hollow cylindrical bell floats mouth downwards in a vessel containing mercury, and the interior of the bell communicates with the air chamber through a vertical pipe. Fairly rapid decrease of external pressure, or increase of internal pressure, causes the bell to rise, and the motion is magnified by a system of levers and communicated to the pen, which records on a chart rotated by clockwork.

It was in putting forward this barometer that Newman called attention to the inaccuracy of the ordinary system of marking off barometer scales from a presumed standard, without regarding the absolute height of the mercury, or the relative proportions of the diameters of the tubes and cisterns.

Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed in 1841, was employed at the Kew Observatory in 1845 for the purpose of registering automatically the height of the barometer. It anticipated the principle of Changeux, who, in 1870, introduced mechanism by which the recording pencil, instead of acting continuously, was left free, and struck by a hammer at definite times. The apparatus consists of a siphon barometer having a float resting upon the surface of the mercury in the open end of the tube, and attached to a cord, which passes round a sector of the short arm of a balance lever, to which it is secured. The other end of the lever carries an ordinary pencil, which is struck at five minute intervals by a clock regulated hammer, and makes a point on a rectangular chart drawn along in a horizontal direction by clockwork.

Object entry information: This barograph, of the type designed by Milne in 1857, resembles in general principles that of Kreil shown adjacent. It is a balance form of siphon barometer, in which the record is obtained by a float placed on the mercury of the short arm, and connected with one arm of a horizontal lever the other arm of which carries a pricker. A small hammer, actuated by the clock train, drives this pricker every hour against a rectangular chart which travels along horizontally to receive the record, and the series of indentations thus made shows the fluctuations in barometric pressure. The paper is ruled in tenths of an inch, and estimations of smaller amounts can be made readily owing to the long range afforded by giving the greater length to the recording arm of the lever. Graduated scales fitted with vernier are attached to the longer and shorter arms of the siphon tube, and enable the barometric height to be read to 0·01 in.

Object name: ADMIRAL FITZROY’S BAROMETER.
Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: probably dates from about 1860.
Object entry information: This barometer, which is of the siphon form, is said to have been the property of Admiral Robert Fitzroy, and probably dates from about 1860. The cistern which forms the short arm of the siphon has a large sectional area compared with that of the main tube, and in consequence the capacity error is small. A graduated scale enables the height of the barometer to be read to 0·1 in., and two pointers are provided so that the reading may be compared with that of the previous day. A mercury thermometer is fitted, and directions are given for forecasting weather from observations of the barometer, thermometer, and anemometer, while there are also tables indicating heights above sea level, with corresponding atmospheric pressures. The instrument also embodies a storm glass, which is a hermetically sealed cylindrical phial, containing crystals of potassium nitrate and ammonium chloride in an alcoholic solution of camphor to which a small amount of distilled water has been added, the upper portion of the phial being filled with air. In fine weather, the crystals are said to remain at the bottom of the tube, leaving the liquid clear, but in stormy weather they are said to rise, when the liquid becomes turbid. These changes, according to Admiral Fitzroy, are due to variation of the mixture with the direction of the wind, whether the glass is exposed in the outer air or in the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room, but according to Tomlinson they are due entirely to variations of light and heat. By others, the instrument is considered to be simply a chemical thermoscope, the changes arising solely from temperature variation.

Maker/Donor: Made by Redier, Paris.
Date of creation: 1875 (Designed)
Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Redier in 1875 to produce mechanically a continuous record of the barometric height without the application of photography or electricity. As the motive force of the mercury is not sufficient to overcome the friction of a pencil on paper, a powerful clockwork movement is employed to do the work, and the barometer only directs the action of the clockwork. In this siphon barometer, a small ivory float rests on the mercury in the short arm, and carries a light, vertical needle, on the top of which rests a very light arm, which has a small ratchet at its end. At the side of the apparatus are two clock movements, working in opposite directions, and a differential train unites this double cistern with a pulley, to the axis of which a cog-wheel is attached. The chronometer escapement tends to draw the pulley and the pencil, and to raise the barometer upwards; the light arm pushed by the ivory float follows the movement, when the ratchet releases a fly, and allows it to revolve, which brings the barometer down again. These small successive movements are followed by the pencil, and thus a straight line is produced if the barometer is stationary, and one varying right or left according as the column rises or falls. On the other side of the barometer are two other movements, one driving the paper-covered cylinder and the other driving a small tapping apparatus to overcome any capillarity in the barometer.

Object entry information: This form of siphon barometer was designed and made by Prof. Guthrie in 1877 with a view to increasing the range of motion and obtaining an extremely sensitive instrument. It consists of a siphon barometer in which a horizontal spiral of small internal diameter containing an air bubble forms the connection between the two vertical tubes of larger diameter. Any variation of atmospheric pressure causes the height of the column of mercury in the longer arm to rise or fall by one-half of this amount, and in consequence the bubble moves along the spiral, through a distance determined by the relative sectional areas of the vertical and spiral tubes.

Object entry information: This instrument is a modification of the ordinary mercurial barometer, in which a more extended scale is obtained, and the sensitiveness is increased. It consists of a barometrical tube of the siphon form, about 36 in. long, one side of which is closed at the upper end and filled with mercury, thus creating a vacuum as in an ordinary barometer. To the open end is joined a second tube, having a much smaller internal diameter, so as to form a U-tube of which both arms are parallel. The smaller tube, which is open at the upper end and partly filled with glycerine, is provided with glycerine traps near its lower end, which serve to receive the glycerine when the instrument is tilted, and thus prevent it from mixing with the mercury.

Object entry information: This pediment barometer is of the siphon type, and is so designed that it can be read by night as well as by day. The small arm of the siphon tube contains a metal plunger, which floats on the mercury and rises and falls with the liquid. It is connected with a balancing weight by a fine cord passing over a pulley at the centre of the dial, which it causes to revolve, and which, by its rotary motion, moves the pointer over the circular scale. It is fitted with a translucent face, which can be illuminated from behind by artificial light, as patented by Mr. Hinton in 1862, so that the barometer and thermometer scales can be observed.

Maker/Donor: Made by Redier, Paris.
Date of creation: 1875 (Designed)
Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Redier in 1875 to produce mechanically a continuous record of the barometric height without the application of photography or electricity. As the motive force of the mercury is not sufficient to overcome the friction of a pencil on paper, a powerful clockwork movement is employed to do the work, and the barometer only directs the action of the clockwork. In this siphon barometer, a small ivory float rests on the mercury in the short arm, and carries a light, vertical needle, on the top of which rests a very light arm, which has a small ratchet at its end. At the side of the apparatus are two clock movements, working in opposite directions, and a differential train unites this double cistern with a pulley, to the axis of which a cog-wheel is attached. The chronometer escapement tends to draw the pulley and the pencil, and to raise the barometer upwards; the light arm pushed by the ivory float follows the movement, when the ratchet releases a fly, and allows it to revolve, which brings the barometer down again. These small successive movements are followed by the pencil, and thus a straight line is produced if the barometer is stationary, and one varying right or left according as the column rises or falls. On the other side of the barometer are two other movements, one driving the paper-covered cylinder and the other driving a small tapping apparatus to overcome any capillarity in the barometer.

Object entry information: This form of siphon barometer was designed and made by Prof. Guthrie in 1877 with a view to increasing the range of motion and obtaining an extremely sensitive instrument. It consists of a siphon barometer in which a horizontal spiral of small internal diameter containing an air bubble forms the connection between the two vertical tubes of larger diameter. Any variation of atmospheric pressure causes the height of the column of mercury in the longer arm to rise or fall by one-half of this amount, and in consequence the bubble moves along the spiral, through a distance determined by the relative sectional areas of the vertical and spiral tubes.

It consists of a barometrical tube of the siphon form, about 36 in. long, one side of which is closed at the upper end and filled with mercury, thus creating a vacuum as in an ordinary barometer. To the open end is joined a second tube, having a much smaller internal diameter, so as to form a U-tube of which both arms are parallel. The smaller tube, which is open at the upper end and partly filled with glycerine, is provided with glycerine traps near its lower end, which serve to receive the glycerine when the instrument is tilted, and thus prevent it from mixing with the mercury.

Object entry information: These instruments, the movements of which are visible, are of the type designed and introduced by Mr. Bourdon in 1850 as a modification of the ordinary form of aneroid. In this case the movement consists of a thin circular-shaped elastic metal tube of elliptic section, closed at its ends, and exhausted of air. On increase of atmospheric pressure, the ends approach each other, and on decrease of pressure, recede. This motion is communicated by gearing to a central shaft carrying an index hand, which traverses a dial plate. The graduations are in tenths of an inch from 28 to 31 in., and weather indications are also given, whilst a movable pointer indicates any rise or fall in the barometer since the last reading.

Object entry information: This aneroid is so arranged that the mechanism can be readily seen and its method of operation examined. It consists of a thin, partially exhausted, metallic vessel, the surface of which is corrugated in concentric circles to render it more sensitive to pressure variation. To the centre of the upper corrugated surface is attached a vertical rod, the other end of which is secured to a horizontal brass arm, pivotally mounted on a horizontal shaft. Pressure variation causes movement of the corrugated cover of the aneroid chamber, and the horizontal arm is rocked about its axis. By means of a system of levers and a silk cord, this motion is transmitted to a vertical shaft which is caused to revolve, carrying with it an index which travels over the graduated circular scale. The scale is graduated in tenths of an inch, and is also marked as a weather glass.

Object entry information: This instrument is designed to enable a close reading of altitude to be obtained without the application of a vernier scale or the customary calculations. The movement of the aneroid is compensated, and closely resembles that of the adjacent instrument. It is furnished with two scales, the inner fixed scale being known as the ""pressure scale,"" and graduated in fiftieths of an inch from 25 to 31 in., and the outer and movable one as the ""altitude scale."" This revolving altitude scale consists of three concentric circles, each division on the outer circle representing 100 ft., each division on the inner circle 20 ft., and these are sub-divided to 10 ft. by means of the middle circle of divisions. These divisions are so arranged that in connection with the index hand the altitude can be read to 5 ft. or less. Half the altitude scale, known as the ""ascent"" scale, is divided to the left and coloured black, and the other half, known as the ""descent"" scale, to the right and coloured red. The altitude scale is calculated by taking 30 on the pressure scale as zero, at a mean temperature of air 50° F., and as the movement of the aneroid is designed to give an equally divided altitude scale in a closed circle, no error is introduced when the zero is shifted. A small pointer is carried on a bezel ring which can be revolved independently of the altitude scale, while a reading lens is provided to eliminate paralactic error. For the purpose of ascertaining the air temperature a swing thermometer is supplied, which is graduated from 20° F. to 160° F.

Object entry information: This instrument is designed to enable a close reading of altitude to be obtained without the application of a vernier scale or the customary calculations. The movement of the aneroid is compensated, and closely resembles that of the adjacent instrument. It is furnished with two scales, the inner fixed scale being known as the ""pressure scale,"" and graduated in fiftieths of an inch from 25 to 31 in., and the outer and movable one as the ""altitude scale."" This revolving altitude scale consists of three concentric circles, each division on the outer circle representing 100 ft., each division on the inner circle 20 ft., and these are sub-divided to 10 ft. by means of the middle circle of divisions. These divisions are so arranged that in connection with the index hand the altitude can be read to 5 ft. or less. Half the altitude scale, known as the ""ascent"" scale, is divided to the left and coloured black, and the other half, known as the ""descent"" scale, to the right and coloured red. The altitude scale is calculated by taking 30 on the pressure scale as zero, at a mean temperature of air 50° F., and as the movement of the aneroid is designed to give an equally divided altitude scale in a closed circle, no error is introduced when the zero is shifted. A small pointer is carried on a bezel ring which can be revolved independently of the altitude scale, while a reading lens is provided to eliminate paralactic error. For the purpose of ascertaining the air temperature a swing thermometer is supplied, which is graduated from 20° F. to 160° F.

Object entry information: This pocket instrument is designed to give a continuous record of altitude, and for this purpose is used in meteorological work. It consists essentially of an aneroid box, the expansion of which is regulated by the atmospheric pressure, and is communicated by levers to a pointer carrying a pen which moves over the chart. This chart is mounted on two cylinders, which are rotated by clockwork, so that a record is produced from which the altitude at any given time can be determined. The altitude scale of the record indicates heights up to 20,000 ft., and at right angles to this is set the time scale.

Object entry information: This represents the modern type of compensated aneroid, designed for the use of the Admiralty. It consists of a vacuum chamber composed of two discs of corrugated nickel silver firmly soldered together, forming a box, from which the air is exhausted, and to each side of which is attached a brass centre, one having a hole drilled across it to receive a knife-edge, which suspends the vacuum chamber from a powerful spring. A circular iron base plate carries the vacuum chamber, across which is fixed a strong carriage supporting the mainspring, and to which is attached a compound iron and brass main lever in order to compensate for temperature changes. A small steel rod connects the end of this arm to the regulator, which is furnished at its centre with a vertical arm of brass, by which it communicates with the movement. A length of fine chain, as used in the works of watches, is attached to and works round the arbor on the rise or fall of the lever, and a fine hair-spring of coiled steel keeps the hand in its proper position. The hand is carried by the arbor and moves over a silvered brass scale the graduations of which are engraved in inches and millibars.

Object entry information: The sympiesometer is particularly useful for observations at sea, as it is not liable to damage by the motion of the ship during stormy weather. This instrument is almost identical in form with the one shown adjacent. Air has access to the lower tube, and by the aid of its pressure on the surface of the liquid, both the weight of the column of liquid and the pressure of the gas in the longer branch are balanced. With a change of barometric pressure equilibrium is disturbed, and a variation in the heights of the liquid in the two branches takes place. Correction for temperature having been made, the barometric height can be found from the height of the column in the longer branch. This temperature correction is made mechanically by a sliding scale to represent inches, which is moved along the temperature scale until its index is in line with the number which corresponds with the thermometer, when the graduation on the sliding scale in line with the top of the liquid column will indicate the height of the barometer, and can be read to 0·02 in.

Object entry information: The sympiesometer is now used chiefly in conjunction with the mercurial and aneroid barometers, for purposes of comparison. Its indications result partly from the pressure and partly from the temperature of the atmosphere; it would, therefore, be more correctly named a thermo-barometer. It consists of a capillary tube of syphon form, provided with a bulb at each end, while near the bottom of the longer limb is a fine constriction. The upper end of the tube is sealed while the lower end is open, and the bulb at this end is partially filled with coloured liquid which also rises in the longer arm. A mercury thermometer is also provided, graduated in half degrees from 30° F. to 110° F. In using the instrument, the temperature of the thermometer is first noted, after which the metal pointer of the pressure scale is adjusted to the same reading as is indicated on the thermometer. The height at which the coloured liquid then stands shows, on the sliding scale, the atmospheric pressure to the nearest fiftieth of an inch on the barometer scale.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: It consists of a U-tube, the longer arm of which is a capillary tube terminating in a small cast iron cistern containing mercury, the air in this cistern, though not in actual communication with the external air, is kept at atmospheric pressure by being in communication with a long purse-shaped case of thin paraffinéd paper, which will yield to any slight pressure variation. When the tube is horizontal, the mercury lies on one side of the cistern, leaving the open end of the tube exposed to the air, but when the tube is brought into a vertical position the mercury flows over and closes the mouth of the tube, flowing down the tube to a greater or lesser depth dependent upon the atmospheric pressure at the time. The capacity of the whole tube is designed so as to be 35 times that of a single inch of the capillary tubing, so that if the barometer is standing at 30 in. the mercury will descend 5 in., and if at 29 in. it will descend 6 in. A scale of inches being placed behind the tube, the reading of the end of the mercury column against this scale indicates the height of the barometer. To read the barometer, the tube is brought into the vertical position, and moved to and fro until the mercury has settled, when the reading should be taken at once to avoid temperature errors.

The instrument is mounted on a stand bearing another thermometer to indicate the external air temperature. The empty bulb is covered with muslin which is tied round it, and upon which a little ether is poured. Cold produced by rapid evaporation of the ether condenses the ether vapour inside the empty bulb as fast as it is formed in the blackened bulb, and by this action the temperature in the blackened bulb is lowered.

Object entry information: This hygrometer which has its bulb at an acute angle is of a type designed and made by Jones in 1826, and resembles closely that of Koerner in 1822. It consists of a mercurial thermometer which can be used to obtain both the temperature of the air and the dew-point. For the latter purpose the bulb has a black enlarged and convex top on which the deposition of moisture is observed. The other portion of the bulb is covered with silk, and over this ether is poured to lower the temperature of the mercury, as in Daniell’s and other condensation instruments. The thermometer which is about 4·5 in. long is supported by a brass wire attached to the case, and can be set at any desired angle. (See Phil. Trans., 1826, p. 53.)

Object entry information: This hygrometer is of the type designed by Daniell in 1819, and consists of two bulbs connected by a glass tube bent twice at right angles. One of these bulbs is blackened and the other is covered with fine muslin. In the limb terminating in the blackened bulb is fixed a sensitive thermometer, and a similar thermometer is attached to the pillar supporting the instrument. The blackened bulb contains a small quantity of pure ether, whilst the tube and the other bulb are filled with ether vapour, all the air having been carefully removed. To use this instrument, it should be turned so that all the ether flows into the blackened bulb. A little ether is then dropped on the muslin until a ring of dew is deposited on the black bulb. Both thermometers should then be read instantly, and again at the moment of disappearance of the dew. The mean of the readings of each thermometer gives respectively the temperature of the air and the dew-point.

Object entry information: This hygrometer is of the form designed by Daniell in 1819. It is an instrument for determining the “dew-point” or the temperature at which the aqueous vapour contained in the air begins to be condensed, and consists of a glass siphon connecting two bulbs. One of the bulbs is blackened and contains ether, into which dips a small thermometer for the determination of the temperature of the liquid. The instrument is mounted on a stand bearing another thermometer to indicate the external air temperature. The empty bulb is covered with muslin which is tied round it, and upon which a little ether is poured. Cold produced by rapid evaporation of the ether condenses the ether vapour inside the empty bulb as fast as it is formed in the blackened bulb, and by this action the temperature in the blackened bulb is lowered. As soon as the dew-point is reached, aqueous vapour from the air condenses as dew on the black bulb, and at that instant the readings of the two thermometers must be observed.

It is a condensation instrument in which the dew-point is determined by noting the temperature at which dew is deposited on a horizontal sheet of glass. Ice and water, or cold water only, are put into the small upright cistern, whence the water flows under a thermometer to a small chamber in which rests the bulb of the thermometer. The bulb and chamber are covered with a thin black glass plate. As the water flows out of the pipe at the further extremity of the hygrometer the temperature of the black glass plate is lowered to the dew-point and a film of moisture is deposited upon the plate. The temperature at which this deposition of dew takes place can be noted from the thermometer, and the dew-point temperature thus ascertained. The temperature of the surrounding air is then read, when the hygrometric state of the atmosphere can be calculated by the usual methods. (See Symons, Meteorological Magazine, Vol. VI, 1871, p. 146.)

Object entry information: This instrument, which is a modification of the adjacent form, was designed by Mr. G. Dines in 1879. The essential feature of this hygrometer is that the glass is mounted in a vertical position, while ether may be employed instead of water, a receptacle for its storage being supplied. Ether is poured in at the spout, to which is connected a breathing tube, and cooling is produced by forcing air through the ether, when moisture is deposited on the black glass plate as in the horizontal instrument.

Object entry information: filled with water and the tap at its base turned, air is drawn past the thermometer bulbs and through the two cylinders; in passing through the one containing ether, rapid evaporation is produced, the temperature falls, and when the cylinder is dimmed by the deposition of dew, the thermometer carried by this cylinder indicates the dew-point temperature, and the other one the temperature of the atmosphere. It is claimed that this instrument has a greater degree of accuracy than Daniell's, for the whole of the ether being maintained at one temperature by the agitation produced by the air, the indications of the dew-point thermometer are more reliable. The error in the readings arising from the proximity of the observer may be avoided by the use of a telescope. (See Ann. de Chimie, Vol. XV, p. 129.)

Object name: GEISSLER'S HYGROMETER.
Maker/Donor: Made by Geissler, Bonn.
Date of creation: about 1876
Object entry information: This instrument, which was introduced about 1876, is a modification of Daniell's hygrometer, in which the dew-point and the temperature of the surrounding air are obtained from two separate thermometers mounted on one stand. The dew-point thermometer has a double cylindrical bulb in the interstitial space of which, is the mercury which forms the bulb of the thermometer. The cylinders are welded into one about half-way up, and thus the thermometer bulb is closed; then the cylinder is contracted to a tube which terminates in a hollow spherical bulb. Before closing this bulb a little ether is poured through it and the tube of the inner cylinder, while the terminal bulb after sealing is covered with muslin. The action of the instrument is as follows: Ether when dropped on the muslin evaporates and cools the bulb, the ether in the thermometer bulb cylinder evaporates and also cools, thereby reducing the temperature of the double cylindrical bulb until dew is deposited on its surface, when the temperature can be read off at once. Both thermometers are graduated to read to 0·2° C.

Maker/Donor: Made and lent by L. Casella, Esq.
Date of creation: 1871
Object entry information: This represents the original type of dew-point hygrometer as designed by Mr. G. Dines in 1871. It is a condensation instrument in which the dew-point is determined by noting the temperature at which dew is deposited on a horizontal sheet of glass. Ice and water, or cold water only, are put into the small upright cistern, whence the water flows under a thermometer to a small chamber in which rests the bulb of the thermometer. The bulb and chamber are covered with a thin black glass plate. As the water flows out of the pipe at the further extremity of the hygrometer the temperature of the black glass plate is lowered to the dew-point and a film of moisture is deposited upon the plate. The temperature at which this deposition of dew takes place can be noted from the thermometer, and the dew-point temperature thus ascertained. The temperature of the surrounding air is then read, when the hygrometric state of the atmosphere can be calculated by the usual methods. (See Symons, Meteorological Magazine, Vol. VI, 1871, p. 146.)

In this form of instrument the change in dimensions of a thin board under the influence of damp or dry weather is made to indicate on a scale variations in the humidity of the atmosphere. In the instrument here exhibited, a thin board, about 14 in. long and 1 3/8 in. wide, is arranged on its edge, with the fibres running transversely to the length. Near one end of the board a lever is fixed in such a way that the longitudinal expansion of the wood actuates the shorter end of the lever, and causes the long arm to give a magnified indication on a paper scale of the expansion of the board. When dryness causes the board to shrink, a counterpoise brings the index back to its original position. This type of hygrometer was considered by some to be a more reliable instrument than the oat-beard hygrometer which preceded it.

Object entry information: This wood hygrometer is a modification of Conier's first wood thermometer of 1670, and Arderon's of 1746. In this instrument a thin slab of wood is cut across the grain and fitted in a frame furnished with a graduated arc and an index. The axis of the index is attached to the wood so that the expansion or contraction of the slab by increase or diminution of humidity of the air causes a motion of the index along the scale. The graduations range from 0° to 100°, the limit at one end being ""Desiccation"" and at the other ""Immersion.""

Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed by Prof. Ernst Friedrich Klinkerfues of Göttingen about 1870, is a hair hygrometer actuated by the stiffness of the hair and not by its variation in length. A wisp of hairs is passed through holes at each end of a small cross-bar of the spindle which carries the index, and the ends of the wisp are made fast to a plate near the top of the instrument. A second and shorter wisp is also passed, but in a contrary direction to the first, through the same holes, crossed, and the ends secured to a bar near the bottom. In this way a twist is given to the hairs acting on the spindle, and the index made to take up a position dependent upon the balance of the torsions of the upper and lower wisps. With a change in the humidity the balance is disturbed, and the change made apparent by the movement of the index towards one or other of the extremes of the scale. A thermometer and reduction disc are supplied by which air temperature can be obtained and the dew-point calculated.

Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed by Prof. Ernst Friedrich Klinkerfues of Göttingen about 1870, is a hair hygrometer actuated by the stiffness of the hair and not by its variation in length. A wisp of hairs is passed through holes at each end of a small cross-bar of the spindle which carries the index, and the ends of the wisp are made fast to a plate near the top of the instrument. A second and shorter wisp is also passed, but in a contrary direction to the first, through the same holes, crossed, and the ends secured to a bar near the bottom. In this way a twist is given to the hairs acting on the spindle, and the index made to take up a position dependent upon the balance of the torsions of the upper and lower wisps. With a change in the humidity the balance is disturbed, and the change made apparent by the movement of the index towards one or other of the extremes of the scale. A thermometer and reduction disc are supplied by which air temperature can be obtained and the dew-point calculated. (See Klinkerfues, ""Theorie des Bifilar-Hygrometers mit gleichtheiliger Prozent-Scala."")

Object entry information: This instrument is designed to furnish a continuous record of the humidity of the atmosphere. It consists essentially of a wisp of hairs securely clamped at both ends and passing over a hook mid-way between the ends. Contraction of the hairs due to decrease of atmospheric humidity causes the hook to be moved outwards to the right, while a spring controls the hook in the reverse direction as the humidity increases. The motion of the hook is communicated by a series of levers to the pen, which traces the record on a chart carried by the revolving drum. The chart is graduated from 0 to 100 indicating respectively absolute dryness and complete saturation.

By evaporation from these pipes, the amount of moisture in the air is increased until the desired humidity is attained, when the action ceases. A pencil attached to one of the levers can be made to record on a chart the motion of the mercury tube, and this record can be checked by readings of the Mason's hygrometer. (See Proc. Roy.

Object name: GALTON’S TRACE COMPUTER.
Maker/Donor: Designed by Sir Francis Galton, F.R.S. Lent by The Meteorological Office.
Date of creation: 1870
Object entry information: This instrument was designed in 1870 by Sir Francis Galton, F.R.S., for deducing a curve of vapour tension from the corresponding curves of the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, and was employed at the Meteorological Office for deducing curves of vapour tension from reduced copies of thermograms for publication in the Quarterly Weather Report. The instrument consists essentially of three portions :— First.—A carriage for holding the two traces from which the third is to be deduced. This carriage is moved from side to side of the instrument by means of a rack and pinion controlled by the operator’s right hand, the line of movement being governed by bevelled wheels running in grooves. To the front of the carriage there is fixed a frame, the upper part of which carries a plate intended to receive the deduced curve. The movement of this plate is therefore similar to that of the two curves to be operated upon. Second.—The second part of the instrument consists of another carriage, having a movement along a track at right angles to that of the first, and carrying a templet with a specially curved surface, corresponding to the required function of the two variables, which in this particular case is the value of the vapour tension for a given temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb. Motion is given to this carriage by a milled head and screw controlled by the operator’s left hand, but an independent movement can be given to the templet from side to side of the carriage by means of another screw at the end of an arm which carries a pair of microscopes arranged to follow the wet and dry bulb traces respectively. Third.—The third section of the instrument is placed immediately above the templet, and consists of a partially counterpoised frame which can move up and down in a set of vertical grooves. The frame terminates in a style which rests lightly upon the templet, whilst at the top it carries a horizontal tube in which slides a pricker, held back in the tube by a spring. When the microscopes have been set so that their cross wires intersect respectively the dry and wet bulb traces, the pricker is struck by a hammer moved by the operator’s foot, and a dot is made on the plate. The distance of this dot below a zero, previously ruled upon the plate, corresponds to the height upon the templet at which the style rests at the moment when the blow is delivered and to the tabular values of the vapour tension for the temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb indicated by the two traces. The succession of dots made at half-hour intervals was connected by a graver, so as to form a continuous curve, which was transferred to a copper plate by means of a pantagraph.

Lent by The Meteorological Office.",1870,"This instrument was designed in 1870 by Sir Francis Galton, F.R.S., for deducing a curve of vapour tension from the corresponding curves of the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, and was employed at the Meteorological Office for deducing curves of vapour tension from reduced copies of thermograms for publication in the Quarterly Weather Report. The instrument consists essentially of three portions :— First.—A carriage for holding the two traces from which the third is to be deduced. This carriage is moved from side to side of the instrument by means of a rack and pinion controlled by the operator’s right hand, the line of movement being governed by bevelled wheels running in grooves. To the front of the carriage there is fixed a frame, the upper part of which carries a plate intended to receive the deduced curve. The movement of this plate is therefore similar to that of the two curves to be operated upon. Second.—The second part of the instrument consists of another carriage, having a movement along a track at right angles to that of the first, and carrying a templet with a specially curved surface, corresponding to the required function of the two variables, which in this particular case is the value of the vapour tension for a given temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb. Motion is given to this carriage by a milled head and screw controlled by the operator’s left hand, but an independent movement can be given to the templet from side to side of the carriage by means of another screw at the end of an arm which carries a pair of microscopes arranged to follow the wet and dry bulb traces respectively. Third.—The third section of the instrument is placed immediately above the templet, and consists of a partially counterpoised frame which can move up and down in a set of vertical grooves. The frame terminates in a style which rests lightly upon the templet, whilst at the top it carries a horizontal tube in which slides a pricker, held back in the tube by a spring. When the microscopes have been set so that their cross wires intersect respectively the dry and wet bulb traces, the pricker is struck by a hammer moved by the operator’s foot, and a dot is made on the plate. The distance of this dot below a zero, previously ruled upon the plate, corresponds to the height upon the templet at which the style rests at the moment when the blow is delivered and to the tabular values of the vapour tension for the temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb indicated by the two traces. The succession of dots made at half-hour intervals was connected by a graver, so as to form a continuous curve, which was transferred to a copper plate by means of a pantagraph.

In using the instrument, this arm is moved to the scale on the left near the wet bulb, and the sliding pointer is set to the temperature indicated by the wet bulb thermometer. The arm is then moved to the right until the pointer is on the curved red line corresponding with the reading of the dry bulb thermometer. The relative humidity is then indicated on the graduated arc at the bottom of the chart, while the dew-point is given on the printed dry bulb scale by the intersection of the thick curved black lines. The absolute humidity is indicated by the numbers at the upper end of these lines, which give the amount of water in grains per cubic foot of air.

Object name: MCLEOD'S SUNSHINE RECORDER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Prof. H. McLeod, F.R.S.
Date of creation: Designed by Prof. McLeod about 1886
Object entry information: This original sunshine recorder was designed by Prof. McLeod about 1886, and was subsequently modified and produced commercially. It consists of a glass sphere silvered inside and placed before the lens of a camera, the axis of the instrument being adjusted parallel to the polar axis of the earth. The light from the sun is reflected from the globe and some of it passing through the double-convex lens forms an image on a piece of prepared paper within the camera. In consequence of the rotation of the earth, the image describes the arc of a circle on the paper and when the sun is obscured this arc is necessarily discontinuous. The image is not on a point, but a line, and in certain relative positions of the sphere, lens, and paper, the line is radial and very thin, so that the obscuration of the sun for only one minute is indicated by a weakening of the image. The record is divided into hourly intervals, when the position of the meridian has been determined, by drawing radial lines at angles of 15°. Ferro-prussiate paper is used for the records, which are fixed by washing them in water for a few minutes. Examples of the traces, divided for the hours, are exhibited with the apparatus. (See Jour. Phys. Soc., Vol. VI., p. 216.)

Maker/Donor: Made and lent by Th. Usteri-Reinacher, Zurich. (Designed by Dr. J. Maurer)
Date of creation: Designed by Dr. J. Maurer about 1886
Object entry information: This photographic sunshine recorder which was designed by Dr. J. Maurer about 1886, is similar in principle to that of Jordan. It consists of a cylindrical dark chamber of brass having its top oblique to the axis and pierced with a small rectangular hole. The bottom of the cylinder is removable to allow the sensitized papers which are accommodated inside to be adjusted. A small latitude arc is fitted below the instrument, and the whole is supported on an iron stand. If the cylinder be fixed with its axis adjusted for latitude, and its North South line in the meridian, the sun's rays passing through the hole at the top, leave a record of their course on the sensitized paper, and as this record is approximately a straight line at right angles to the hour lines engraved on the paper, the duration of sunshine for any particular period can be readily ascertained. The record should be washed in water, after removal from the cylinder, in order to fix it.

Object name: JORDAN'S TWIN-CYLINDER SUNSHINE RECORDER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by J. B. Jordan, Esq.
Date of creation: Introduced by Jordan in 1888
Object entry information: This instrument which is an improvement on the single cylinder type shown adjacent, was introduced by Jordan in 1888. It consists of two semi-cylindrical dark chambers of brass, one to contain the morning and the other the afternoon record. The chambers are placed with their diametral planes outwards and at an angle of 63°, while they are hinged to a stand having a latitude arc. An aperture for admitting the beam of sunlight is placed in the centre of the rectangular side of each box, so that the length of the beam within the chamber is the radius of the cylindrical surface on which it is projected. Its path therefore at all seasons follows a straight line on the record. The apertures for the admission of the sun's rays are so placed as to receive the early and late sunshine, and as there is only one aperture in each chamber, the amount of diffused light admitted is much less than in the single cylinder instrument, while the fact that the morning and afternoon charts are placed in separate cylinders offers improved facilities for changing the charts.

To effect this, the bulb and part of the stem are blackened, and the whole thermometer enclosed in a glass shield as nearly as possible exhausted of air, so that results may be unaffected by passing air currents or by the presence of moisture in the surrounding atmosphere. These thermometers are supported on specially constructed stands, to prevent their receiving heat from objects in their vicinity. They are occasionally made with mercurial vacuum gauges and other appliances for indicating the state of exhaustion of the air enclosed in the shield. Sir John Herschel, in the “Admiralty Manual” of 1849, suggested this design of instrument, and many have been constructed since, which give favourable results as compared with other forms of apparatus for measuring the intensity of solar radiation.

Object name: HERSCHEL'S ACTINOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Presented by Sir J. Hooker, F.R.S.
Date of creation: Devised by Sir J. Herschel in 1825.
Object entry information: This actinometer which is of the type devised by Sir J. Herschel in 1825, was used by Sir J. Hooker in his investigations when travelling in the Himalayas. It consists of a glass cylinder filled with a solution of ammoniacal sulphate of copper, to one end of which is connected a tube with an arbitrary scale of equal parts, while to the other end a screw is fitted which may be used to adjust the liquid in the tube, the whole forming a delicate thermometer. The temperature of the liquid is ascertained by a thermometer having its bulb in the liquid, and its stem passing through the screw. By noting on the arbitrary scale the height of the liquid immediately before and after the instrument has been exposed to the sun’s rays for a definite time, and also making similar observations when it is set in the shade, a measure of the heating effect of the sun’s rays can be ascertained. This can be corrected for the unequal expansion of the liquid with the aid of readings given by the alcohol thermometer. Herschel suggested that not less than three sun observations, and two intermediate shade observations should be taken, the calculations to be made from the means of the readings in each position. The unit of solar radiation adopted in the ultimate reduction of the observation was the “Actine.” By this is understood, “that intensity of solar radiation which, at a vertical incidence, and supposing it wholly absorbed, would suffice to melt one millionth part of a metre in thickness from the surface of a sheet of ice horizontally exposed to its action per minute of mean solar time.” (See Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry. Article on Meteorology by Sir J. Herschel.)

Object entry information: Sir John Herschel in 1849 suggested enclosing the black bulb of an ordinary radiation thermometer in a vacuum tube, so as to prevent loss of heat due to radiation from the black bulb. The two examples shown are made in this manner and were used on the British (“Discovery”) Antarctic Expedition of 1901. The indications are 20° F. to 30° F. higher than those of a similar instrument with exposed bulb. The larger example is graduated in degrees from 3° F. to 203° F. and the smaller from 10° F. to 207° F.

It was adopted as the international standard instrument by the Innsbruck meeting of the International Conference in 1905. The instrument consists essentially of two similar strips of thin blackened manganin foil, arranged side by side on a small circular ebonite frame, and connectd to two constantan copper thermo-junctions, so that no current will flow if the two strips are at the same temperature. The strips are mounted in a tube provided with three diaphragms, on the front end of which a double walled reversible screen is arranged, which may be used to protect one or other of the strips from external radiations. An ebonite stopper closes the other end of the tube and carries terminals for the thermo-element and the strip. A commutator enables the current to be sent through either strip as required, and a thermometer is fitted to the tube, which may be sighted in any direction. The auxiliary apparatus necessarily consists of a sensitive galvanometer and adjustable resistance, a milliamperemeter and an accumulator, the last three being connected in series with the strip. If now we know the width, resistance, and coefficient of absorption of the strips, we can calculate the absolute value of the radiation, when a balance is obtained, by equating the electrical power absorbed in the screened strip to the radiated power absorbed by the exposed strip, thus:— If $B$=width of strip in cm., $a$=the power of absorption (0.985), $q$=radiation in C.G.S. units, $r$=resistance of unit length of the strips, $i$=strength of electric compensation current: then $baq$=radiated energy, and this is equal to $\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18}$=electrical energy; whence $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba}$ gram calories per second per sq. cm. or $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba} \times 60$ calories per second per sq. cm. Adjustments are provided on the pyrheliometer, by means of which the instrument may be correctly sighted to the sun, this being obtained when the ray of light passing through the pin-hole on the top of the instrument is focussed on the cross-wires. One strip should now be exposed, and the current directed through the other strip and adjusted until no deflection is obtained. The test should then be repeated with the other strip exposed, and the current passing through the one which was previously exposed. Owing to slight lack of symmetry between the strips, the readings may disagree slightly, and a mean should be taken for the final result.

Object name: ÅNGSTRÖM'S COMPENSATED PYRHELIOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Made by The Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co.
Date of creation: Invented in 1886 by Knut Ångström
Object entry information: This instrument, which was invented in 1886 by Knut Ångström for the absolute determination of heat radiation, provides a method of measuring solar radiation, and is also suitable for experimental work in the laboratory. It was adopted as the international standard instrument by the Innsbruck meeting of the International Conference in 1905. The instrument consists essentially of two similar strips of thin blackened manganin foil, arranged side by side on a small circular ebonite frame, and connectd to two constantan copper thermo-junctions, so that no current will flow if the two strips are at the same temperature. The strips are mounted in a tube provided with three diaphragms, on the front end of which a double walled reversible screen is arranged, which may be used to protect one or other of the strips from external radiations. An ebonite stopper closes the other end of the tube and carries terminals for the thermo-element and the strip. A commutator enables the current to be sent through either strip as required, and a thermometer is fitted to the tube, which may be sighted in any direction. The auxiliary apparatus necessarily consists of a sensitive galvanometer and adjustable resistance, a milliamperemeter and an accumulator, the last three being connected in series with the strip. If now we know the width, resistance, and coefficient of absorption of the strips, we can calculate the absolute value of the radiation, when a balance is obtained, by equating the electrical power absorbed in the screened strip to the radiated power absorbed by the exposed strip, thus:— If $B$=width of strip in cm., $a$=the power of absorption (0.985), $q$=radiation in C.G.S. units, $r$=resistance of unit length of the strips, $i$=strength of electric compensation current: then $baq$=radiated energy, and this is equal to $\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18}$=electrical energy; whence $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba}$ gram calories per second per sq. cm. or $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba} \times 60$ calories per second per sq. cm.

Maker/Donor: Designed and constructed by Mr. Francis Ronalds; Presented by The Meteorological Office.
Date of creation: 1843
Object entry information: This pressure plate anemometer was designed and constructed by Mr. Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory in 1843, for the purpose of measuring the force of the wind. It consists of a light board, 1 ft. sq., fixed transversely to a cross of wood, suspended by a brass axis passing through its centre, and turning in glass tubes in such a way that the system can partially rotate in a vertical plane. The lower end of the bar carrying the board is counterpoised, so as to keep the surface of the board vertical, and a scale pan, hung to one end of the horizontal bar of the cross, serves to receive the weights which are necessary to counterbalance the force of the wind pressing on the board opposed to it, at any time. A small box, covering the scale pan, serves to shield it from the action of the wind. The instrument was, at the time of observation, placed so that the surface of the pressure-plate should stand at right angles with the direction of the wind, as indicated by a vane.

Date of creation: 1858
Object entry information: This apparatus, which indicates both the force and direction of the wind, was designed by Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S., in 1858. It consists of a large bulb open to the atmosphere at the upper end, and terminating at the lower end in a long glass tube, the upper portion of which is L-shaped and supplied with a graduated scale. Coloured liquid is inserted in the bulb until it reaches the zero graduation on the horizontal scale. The instrument is levelled and then turned so that the wind vane and the glass tube are in the same vertical plane, when the elbow attached to the upper end of the bulb is facing in an up-wind direction. The direction of the wind can then be read off by means of the compass in the base of the instrument, while the position of the liquid column on the graduated scale indicates the pressure and velocity of the wind. A table is also provided in which the gauge reading pressure, and velocity are tabulated. (See Symons Monthly Magazine, Vol. ii., p. 52.)

Object entry information: This instrument, which was in use at Holyhead for many years, was designed in 1880 by Sir G. G. Stokes, Bart., F.R.S., to give a measure of the strength of the wind during gusts, the maximum pressure of which is not always registered by a pressure tube anemometer. It was not designed to register light winds, and therefore it is unaffected by any wind of lower velocity than 20 miles per hour. The portion of the instrument which is acted upon by the wind consists of five hemispherical copper cups, each of which is fixed by a short strong arm to a vertical spindle, around which they were originally placed equidistantly, and in the same horizontal plane. In 1890, however, the cups were re-arranged spirally to prevent any possibility of one cup sheltering another. An indication of the wind force is obtained by attaching to the spindle two weights, which are raised by the rotation of the spindle under the action of the wind, the weights being sufficient to prevent the spindle from making one complete rotation, even in the strongest wind. The weights are suspended by flexible cords, which pass over pulleys and attach to the root of two snails carried on the periphery of the snails as the cups turn. Below the spindle, and coaxial with it, is a cylinder which carries the record and also forms the driving weight of the clock, by which its descent is regulated. The pen is carried on an arm of the spindle, each motion of which causes the pen to sweep round the cylinder and trace a record of the corresponding wind speed. In this way, the horizontal ordinates give a measure of the force of the wind, and the abscissæ of the trace become the time-scale. (See “ Report of the Meteorological Council,” 1898, p. 28.)

When carried round by the machine, the pressure of the air is balanced by the centrifugal forces upon the two horizontal bars. Of these the larger is adjusted by hand and clamped, but the final adjustment is effected by the automatic action of the smaller bar. The pressure board is inclinable, and the lever which carries it can be set at any angle with the help of the graduated arc, to which, when used for observations, it is clamped. This arc is connected by an arm and stud with the pivoted frame carrying the two horizontal bars in such a way that the movement in a vertical plane of the lever produces a movement in a horizontal plane of the bars. This allows a pulley to act through a crown wheel, pinion and rack on the smaller bar, which is carried along until equilibrium is established between the wind pressure and the centrifugal force. The pressure is then determined from the positions of the bars, as shown by their graduations. (See Proc. Roy. Soc., 1891, p. 233.)",Inv. 1898-32.,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object name: DYNAMIC ANEMOMETER
Maker/Donor: Lent by W. H. Dines, Esq., F.R.S.
Date of creation: about 1890
Object entry information: This apparatus was designed and constructed by Mr. Dines about 1890 for determining the pressure of the wind on an inclined surface, and is intended to be revolved by some form of whirling machine. When carried round by the machine, the pressure of the air is balanced by the centrifugal forces upon the two horizontal bars. Of these the larger is adjusted by hand and clamped, but the final adjustment is effected by the automatic action of the smaller bar. The pressure board is inclinable, and the lever which carries it can be set at any angle with the help of the graduated arc, to which, when used for observations, it is clamped. This arc is connected by an arm and stud with the pivoted frame carrying the two horizontal bars in such a way that the movement in a vertical plane of the lever produces a movement in a horizontal plane of the bars. This allows a pulley to act through a crown wheel, pinion and rack on the smaller bar, which is carried along until equilibrium is established between the wind pressure and the centrifugal force. The pressure is then determined from the positions of the bars, as shown by their graduations. (See Proc. Roy. Soc., 1891, p. 233.)

Object entry information: This instrument is specially designed to measure the maximum wind pressure. The upper receptacle is filled with shot, which falls through the hole at the bottom, until the weight of the shot in the lower vessel is equal to the pressure of the wind on the plate. As soon as this occurs, the plate moves forward, and at the same time closes the opening. On the occurrence of a stronger gust of wind, the plate is forced back, the hole is opened, and shot falls through until equilibrium is again obtained. To read the instrument, the plate is fastened in its forward position by the catch on the upper receptacle, and the shot is then withdrawn from the lower receptacle and weighed, or, preferably, measured in a glass which has been tabulated once for all. The weight of shot gives the maximum pressure which has occurred since the instrument was last set.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed by W. H. Dines during the last decade of the nineteenth century, and is particularly suitable for use at sea. In making observations, the tube is drawn from its case, and using the latter as a handle, held in a vertical position with the nozzle facing the wind. The height to which the liquid rises in the tube then indicates on the scales the velocity of the wind in miles per hour, and its pressure in pounds per square foot. The instrument is very compact, and is calibrated to read accurately the velocity and force of the wind.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Whewell in 1834, and was in use at the Greenwich Observatory from 1843 until 1862, when it was superseded by Robinson's cup anemometer. At the top of a case containing an upright cylinder marked for the points of the compass, is placed a horizontal circular plate, to which is attached a wind vane and a fly of eight fans. Connected to this plate, but contained in the case, is a vertical screw of some 15 in. long, which is set parallel to the cylinder and carries a nut to which is fastened a pencil. As the horizontal circular plate, by the action of the vane, turns with the wind, the pencil is carried round the cylinder, and the direction of the wind shown from the position of the pencil trace with regard to the compass points. In addition to being carried round, the pencil descends, for the fly being revolved by the wind, turns the vertical screw through the action of the intervening wheelwork, and the pencil carrier is lowered. The time being known during which the wind has been blowing in any particular direction, the velocity of the wind can be ascertained from the length of the trace made by the pencil in its descent.

Object entry information: This instrument, embodying the hemispherical cups first used by Robinson in 1846, is designed for registering the wind, and is graduated in miles and tenths to 500 miles. The rotation imparted to the cups by the wind is transmitted by a vertical rod to a hozirontal spindle furnished with an endless screw which gears with two worm wheels set together behind the dial. With the front wheel, the dial revolves, and with the hind wheel, the long index hand turns. The dial is graduated on its inner circle from 1 to 5 miles, and a reading is taken by the short stationary pointer above it. The outer circle has 100 divisions to represent each 5 miles to 500, the long hand serving as index. This latter indication results from the different rates of revolution of the two wheels. On each complete revolution of the dial wheel the index wheel falls one tooth behind, consequently the hand which moves with it falls one space behind on the dial and thus is apparently advanced one graduation. In this way the 5 miles shown by a complete revolution of the dial are recorded.

As the horizontal circular plate, by the action of the vane, turns with the wind, the pencil is carried round the cylinder, and the direction of the wind shown from the position of the pencil trace with regard to the compass points. In addition to being carried round, the pencil descends, for the fly being revolved by the wind, turns the vertical screw through the action of the intervening wheelwork, and the pencil carrier is lowered. The time being known during which the wind has been blowing in any particular direction, the velocity of the wind can be ascertained from the length of the trace made by the pencil in its descent.

Object name: ROBINSON'S CUP ANEMOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. F. Darton & Co.
Date of creation: 1846
Object entry information: This instrument, embodying the hemispherical cups first used by Robinson in 1846, is designed for registering the wind, and is graduated in miles and tenths to 500 miles. The rotation imparted to the cups by the wind is transmitted by a vertical rod to a hozirontal spindle furnished with an endless screw which gears with two worm wheels set together behind the dial. With the front wheel, the dial revolves, and with the hind wheel, the long index hand turns. The dial is graduated on its inner circle from 1 to 5 miles, and a reading is taken by the short stationary pointer above it. The outer circle has 100 divisions to represent each 5 miles to 500, the long hand serving as index. This latter indication results from the different rates of revolution of the two wheels. On each complete revolution of the dial wheel the index wheel falls one tooth behind, consequently the hand which moves with it falls one space behind on the dial and thus is apparently advanced one graduation. In this way the 5 miles shown by a complete revolution of the dial are recorded.

Object name: D'ONS EN BRAY'S ANEMOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by R. B. Prosser, Esq.
Date of creation: 1734
Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed by D'Ons en Bray in 1734, is the earliest registering anemometer with clockwork gearing of which we have any distinct account, and to some extent resembles Dinglinger's apparatus of 1720. The instrument consists essentially of four portions, a clock movement, a dial for indicating direction, and apparatus for recording direction and velocity respectively. A vane on one side of the instrument is connected by simple gearing to the indicating dial, and so registers the wind direction. The motion of the vane is communicated to a recording apparatus, and the appropriate one of a series of thirty-two pencils, corresponding to the points of the compass, is caused to record the direction on a travelling strip of paper. The velocity of the wind is obtained from the rotational speed of a drum fitted with vanes and driving the recording apparatus through intermediary gearing. (See Histoire de l'Acad. Roy. des Sci., 1734, p. 123.)

Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Whewell in 1834, and was in use at the Greenwich Observatory from 1843 until 1862, when it was superseded by Robinson's cup anemometer. At the top of a case containing an upright cylinder marked for the points of the compass, is placed a horizontal circular plate, to which is attached a wind vane and a fly of eight fans.

In this anemograph, Robinson’s method of measuring the velocity of the wind by the rotation of a system of hemispherical cups is employed, while the wind direction is indicated by Osler’s type of double wheel fan, which acts as a directing vane. A stout tubular support carries the whole of the external part of the apparatus, while a ball-bearing head reduces the friction to a minimum. As the cups are rotated by the wind, motion is given to a tubular shaft passing vertically downwards through the body of the apparatus to an endless screw which operates a worm-wheel, whence it is communicated to a brass spiral which forms the velocity recording device. Any change in the direction of the wind produces a movement of the fans, which is similarly communicated through the body of the instrument to the thin-threaded screw which records direction. The chart, which is revolved by clockwork, is divided into two sections, upon one of which is recorded the motion of the wind and upon the other its direction. (See Brit. Assoc.

Object name: ROBINSON-BECKLEY ANEMOGRAPH.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Meteorological Office. (Designed by Mr. R. Beckley)
Date of creation: 1856 (Design date)
Object entry information: This instrument is of the type designed by Mr. R. Beckley at the Kew Observatory in 1856, for indicating simultaneously on two sections of the same chart the velocity and the direction of the wind. In this anemograph, Robinson’s method of measuring the velocity of the wind by the rotation of a system of hemispherical cups is employed, while the wind direction is indicated by Osler’s type of double wheel fan, which acts as a directing vane. A stout tubular support carries the whole of the external part of the apparatus, while a ball-bearing head reduces the friction to a minimum. As the cups are rotated by the wind, motion is given to a tubular shaft passing vertically downwards through the body of the apparatus to an endless screw which operates a worm-wheel, whence it is communicated to a brass spiral which forms the velocity recording device. Any change in the direction of the wind produces a movement of the fans, which is similarly communicated through the body of the instrument to the thin-threaded screw which records direction. The chart, which is revolved by clockwork, is divided into two sections, upon one of which is recorded the motion of the wind and upon the other its direction. (See Brit. Assoc. Report, 1856, II, p. 38, and 1858, i, p. 306.)

Object entry information: This modification of the Robinson cup anemometer was designed in 1876 for indicating the mean velocity of the wind from the various points of the compass, by Dr. Arthur von Oettinger, Professor at the Imperial University of Dorpat, Russia. In this apparatus the wind moves a system of hemispherical cups, acting on a circular plate, the velocity of which is ordinarily proportional to the velocity of the wind. Four systems of sliding rollers rest on this plate, whose bearings can be moved round a vertical axis, the principal planes of which follow the variations of a wind vane. Each sliding roller can revolve about a horizontal axis, but only in one direction, and after a half rotation an electrical contact is made, the contact being limited to a fraction of a second. When the contact is made, one of four wheels, with number-types, is moved, and every half hour the position of these four wheels is shown by printed numbers on a strip of paper. The differences of these readings represent the mean velocity of the wind from the N., E., S. and W., and are converted into absolute values by means of a table. Different mechanism adjusts the position of each sliding roller. (See Repertorium für Meteorologie, Vol. V.).

There are two spindles, one to support the Robinson cups, and transmit their movement to the circular plate on which the recording wheels rest, the other for the vane to change the position on the plate of the two recording wheels in accordance with the direction of the wind. That this change may be readily effected, the wheels are connected to small carriages which run between tramlines on a plate placed parallel to, and above that which revolves. By the method of connection with the direction spindle, one wheel turns when the wind is at either of the four chief points of the compass, in intermediate directions, as N.E., S.S.W., both are turned. As the speed of the revolving plate is ordinarily proportional to that of the wind, a measure can be obtained of the velocity of the latter from the number of revolutions of the wheels. The recording is effected by an electrical contact made at each turn of the wheels, which allows a current to actuate a set of counters. These counters are contained in a box, and are connected with the instrument by wires to the binding screws which represent the N., S., E., and W. points. The value of the records can be determined either by measurement of the instrument or by direct experiment. (See Phil. Mag., June, 1884.)

Object entry information: This instrument was devised to reconcile adequate exposure of the hemispherical cups with accessibility of the dial of the Robinson cup anemometer. It was specially designed and constructed for stations of the second and third order connected with the Meteorological Office of the Dominion of Canada. The anemometer is fitted with a shaft, the length of which can be adjusted to suit different stations and with a dial reading to 10,000 miles. It consists of a short spindle bearing a small set of Robinson's cups and connected with a horizontal cogged wheel resting on friction rollers, also with a long shaft suspended from its centre, as in the anemographs of the British observatories. It is contrived so that the shaft may make 101 complete turns for 200 miles of wind. The mode of recording the miles is as follows:—At the lower end of the shaft is an endless screw which acts on the circumferences of two toothed wheels of equal diameter, turning in vertical planes about a common axis, and having 100 and 101 teeth respectively. From the centre of the back wheel (that of 100 teeth) projects forwards a short hollow pin which encloses and works on a solid pin fixed to a support behind the back wheel. The front wheel (that of 101 teeth) which turns on the above-named hollow pin, and slides closely on the face of the back wheel, has a graduated ring on its face, containing 100 divisions. The outer ends of the lines of graduation indicate miles, while the inner ends of the same lines, reckoned in the reverse order, indicate hundreds. The endless screw, at every turn, causes both wheels to advance two teeth, so that for 100 miles the front wheel makes one complete turn, or 100 divisions, while the back wheel makes one complete turn and one tooth, and thus advances one division with respect to the front wheel. The miles up to 100 are shown by a fixed pointer, and the hundreds by a pointer attached to the end of the hollow pin. For fractions of a mile there is a contrivance which needs adjustment at each observation. A correction of 1 per cent. nearly, should be subtracted from the fractional parts. If the anemometer be too distant from the observer's office to allow the dial to be read conveniently with the required frequency, it may be connected electrically with a dial or with a self-recording apparatus, but in such a case the master dial should be read periodically as a check on the electrical dial.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Mr. Kingston about 1876, to determine wind direction only, and to meet the case when a vane, if suitable exposed, is too distant to admit of being connected by a shaft with a dial in an inaccessible position. It was devised and constructed for stations of the second and third orders in connection with the Meteorological Office of the Dominion of Canada.
The instrument consists of a flat brass ring surrounding the step of the vane and attached to the bottom of a box. This ring is divided by radial lines into four equal parts corresponding to, but not necessarily in the direction of, the four cardinal points, and separated by small equal intervals. The direction arcs (as they may be termed) are insulated except as regards connexion with their screw cups. Clamped to the spindle, and capable of adjustment in azimuth, is a circuit maker, which consists of an arm bearing a brass arc, which is made to press on the flat brass ring. The length of this arc is 45° + interval between the fixed arcs. The step of the vane is connected by wire with one pole of a battery, and the direction arcs with four screw cups in near proximity to a brass plate fastened to the wall of the office, and so contrived that, by aid of a plug, metallic connexion may be made at will between the brass plate and any one of the four wires. Finally, two wires from the poles of a small telegraph sounder are attached to the brass plate and to the other pole of the battery, and the apparatus is complete. To ascertain the direction of the wind, notice by the sounder which direction arcs or pairs of arcs is placed in circuit as the brass plate is connected by the plug with the four wires in succession. If, for instance, N. only sounds, the direction is nearer to N. than either to N.W. or N.E., unless it be N.N.W. or N.N.E. exactly, but if N. and E. both sound, the direction is nearer to N.E. than either to N. or E., unless it be N.N.E. or E.N.E. exactly. The azimuth of the vane box need be governed only by appearance and the position of the door. To adjust the vane unclamp the circuit maker, and insert a pin provided for the purpose, through the holes at the middle point of the circuit maker and the arc at the left of the box, which arc may represent any one of the four cardinal points. Turn the vane to that point, clamp the circuit maker, and remove the pin, when the adjustment will be complete. The apparatus works well with a single gravity cell, when the vane is 60 ft. or more from the battery and sounder. With a stronger battery it works well at the distance of a mile or more.

Object entry information: This is a differential pressure anemometer in which the effects of pressure and suction caused by air passing two differently disposed orifices, are added to produce an increased movement of a column of liquid.
The instrument consists of a U tube containing liquid with the two branches lying parallel and close together. The upper end of one of the tubes terminates in a brass nozzle having a small hole at its extremity. The other tube carries a brass elbow, the end of which is slightly conical. The anemometer is placed with the horizontal arm of the elbow facing in an upwind direction, so that the pressure of the air in the elbow and attached tube is increased.
The effect of the wind on the orifice of the vertical tube is to create a suction in this tube. The two effects augment each other, and the liquid column rises in the suction tube and falls in the pressure tube. The difference in the vertical height of the liquid in the two branches which is due to the effect of the wind is measured by a moveable scale, from which the velocity of the wind can be read, as well as the corresponding Beaufort number.

The average velocity between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. on the 22nd was about 94 miles per hour, while at certain times during the period the velocity was well over 100 miles per hour.

Object name: WINDMILL VANE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by G. T. Kingston, Esq., M.A.
Date of creation: about 1876
Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Mr. Kingston about 1876, to determine wind direction only, and to meet the case when a vane, if suitable exposed, is too distant to admit of being connected by a shaft with a dial in an inaccessible position. It was devised and constructed for stations of the second and third orders in connection with the Meteorological Office of the Dominion of Canada.
The instrument consists of a flat brass ring surrounding the step of the vane and attached to the bottom of a box. This ring is divided by radial lines into four equal parts corresponding to, but not necessarily in the direction of, the four cardinal points, and separated by small equal intervals. The direction arcs (as they may be termed) are insulated except as regards connexion with their screw cups. Clamped to the spindle, and capable of adjustment in azimuth, is a circuit maker, which consists of an arm bearing a brass arc, which is made to press on the flat brass ring. The length of this arc is 45° + interval between the fixed arcs. The step of the vane is connected by wire with one pole of a battery, and the direction arcs with four screw cups in near proximity to a brass plate fastened to the wall of the office, and so contrived that, by aid of a plug, metallic connexion may be made at will between the brass plate and any one of the four wires. Finally, two wires from the poles of a small telegraph sounder are attached to the brass plate and to the other pole of the battery, and the apparatus is complete. To ascertain the direction of the wind, notice by the sounder which direction arcs or pairs of arcs is placed in circuit as the brass plate is connected by the plug with the four wires in succession. If, for instance, N. only sounds, the direction is nearer to N. than either to N.W. or N.E., unless it be N.N.W. or N.N.E. exactly, but if N. and E. both sound, the direction is nearer to N.E. than either to N. or E., unless it be N.N.E. or E.N.E. exactly. The azimuth of the vane box need be governed only by appearance and the position of the door. To adjust the vane unclamp the circuit maker, and insert a pin provided for the purpose, through the holes at the middle point of the circuit maker and the arc at the left of the box, which arc may represent any one of the four cardinal points. Turn the vane to that point, clamp the circuit maker, and remove the pin, when the adjustment will be complete. The apparatus works well with a single gravity cell, when the vane is 60 ft. or more from the battery and sounder. With a stronger battery it works well at the distance of a mile or more.

Object name: HAGEMANN ANEMOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Meteorological Office.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a differential pressure anemometer in which the effects of pressure and suction caused by air passing two differently disposed orifices, are added to produce an increased movement of a column of liquid.
The instrument consists of a U tube containing liquid with the two branches lying parallel and close together. The upper end of one of the tubes terminates in a brass nozzle having a small hole at its extremity. The other tube carries a brass elbow, the end of which is slightly conical. The anemometer is placed with the horizontal arm of the elbow facing in an upwind direction, so that the pressure of the air in the elbow and attached tube is increased.
The effect of the wind on the orifice of the vertical tube is to create a suction in this tube. The two effects augment each other, and the liquid column rises in the suction tube and falls in the pressure tube. The difference in the vertical height of the liquid in the two branches which is due to the effect of the wind is measured by a moveable scale, from which the velocity of the wind can be read, as well as the corresponding Beaufort number.

Object entry information: This type of air-speed indicator, designed by Col. Alec Ogilvie, is used on kite balloons for determining wind speed. It comprises an “Ogilvie” head, consisting of a pressure and static tube and an indicator connected thereto. The head of the instrument is placed in an upwind direction, so that air in the inner tube becomes compressed by the pressure of the wind, while that in the outer tube is reduced in pressure by the rush of air past the annular ring of holes. The pointer of the indicator moves over a graduated scale, and is actuated by the motion of a diaphragm separating two chambers connected respectively with the two tubes of the head.

Date of creation: Investigations carried out during the years 1887 to 1894.
Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed by Mr. W. H. Dines for recording the velocity of the wind, is the outcome of a long series of experimental investigations into the relations between the velocity and pressure of the wind, carried out at Horsham in Surrey during the years 1887 to 1894. The anemometer consists of two independent parts: the head, which is the part exposed to the wind, and the recording apparatus, which may be set up in any convenient place indoors, the two portions being connected together by flexible metal tubes. The head consists of a vane formed of a horizontal tube open at one end, and pivoted upon the top of a vertical tube into which it leads. The vane is kept in position with its open end facing the wind, and every increase in wind pressure causes a corresponding increase of the pressure in the vertical or pressure tube. Just below the vane this vertical tube is surrounded by another one of much larger diameter, the exterior of which is perforated by four rings of holes placed close together around its circumference. As the wind passes across these perforations, the air in the tube is sucked out, so that a diminution of pressure results in this tube, which is called the suction tube. The recorder consists of a float, which is a specially-shaped cylindrical copper vessel, closed at one end and inverted in a vessel partially filled with water, and sealed from the air in the room. The interior of the float is in connection with the pressure tube, while the suction tube is connected with the top of the closed vessel containing the float. The two forces thus act together, but in opposite ways, to raise the float in the water. To the top of the float is fixed a rod which carries a pen, the point of which rests against a sheet of paper attached to a drum which is rotated by clockwork. With every upward or downward movement of the float, corresponding to an increase or decrease of wind force, the pen leaves a trace upon the paper, and thus the magnitude of every variation of the strength of the wind is graphically registered, together with the time of its occurrence.

One of these discs is pivoted near the end of a boxwood rule, 10 in. long, having 30 divisions, and stamped ""ship moving,"" with an arrow pointing away from the pivot. On this pivot there is also mounted, near one end, a similar rule, about 17 in. long, containing 60 of the above divisions, and marked ""true wind,"" with an arrow directed away from the pivot.

Maker/Donor: Made by R. W. Munro. Lent by The Meteorological Office.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This instrument, of which the head, new type of vane, and recorder are shown, was designed by Mr. W. H. Dines for recording simultaneously the direction and velocity of the wind. The vane, which is exhibited above the case, is mounted on the head of the instrument and is arranged to operate the direction recorder. The connections to the pressure and suction tubes are located on opposite sides of the head, so that they may be separated in order to avoid trouble with snow. The direction recorder, which is of the Meteorological Office pattern, consists of two recording pens actuated by a helix mounted on a vertical shaft, and gives a record on the same chart as the Pressure Tube Anemometer. Whenever the wind changes in direction from N.W. to N.E., the roller on the arm of the upper pen moves on from the helix and the pen is put out of action, while the lower pen is similarly put out of action when the wind changes from N.E. to N.W.

Date of creation: 1829
Object entry information: This instrument, which was devised by Crosley in 1829, is a modification of Wren's bucket gauge, and is fitted with a train of wheels similar to those used for gas meters. It is a 10 in. square gauge, with oscillating bucket and a set of counters contained within the case. Each movement of the bucket caused by the weight of water conveyed alternately to its right and left halves by the gauge, is transmitted to the wheel-work of the counters by a lever acting between two projecting plates on the bucket. There are three counters for cubic inches, tenths and hundredths respectively. A pipette-shaped measure is supplied for testing the accuracy of the registration. This measure will contain 5 cub. in. of water, and its contents should, as the gauge has an area of 100 sq. in., advance the hand of the hundredths counter five divisions.

Object entry information: This instrument is a modification of the Crosley recording rain-gauge from which it differs chiefly in the recording arrangements. In this gauge the oscillating bucket and the wheels for recording its movements are separated by a partition. The bucket, which is constructed to tilt with every tenth of a cubic inch of water, actuates a pin wheel of somewhat large diameter. The wheel is marked on its periphery by tenths from 1 to 5 cub. in., and as the vibrations of the bucket turn the wheel, the amount of rainfall within these limits can be read from an opening in the side of the case. For higher readings, a dial marked for 5 to 100 cub. in., which is in connection with the graduated wheel, is used.

It consists of two cylindrical vessels, connected by a tube, the one being 1 ft. in diam., and open at the top, whilst the other is 3 in. and (with the exception of a small hole) entirely closed by a cover, which carries a frame, holding a circular divided arc, with an index moving over it. The index is attached to a small pulley, over which a cord passes, having its end fixed to the float in the cylinder. This, rising and falling with the changes of water level, indicates the amount of rain or evaporation on the metal scale. (See Brit. Assoc. Rept., 1844, p. 128.)

Object entry information: This gauge was constructed under the directions of Dr. H. R. Mill especially for use in outlying districts, where the instrument is visited at long intervals only. It is arranged so that a large quantity of water may be collected from a 5-in. funnel, as advocated by the British Rainfall Organisation, in a receiver of 8 in. diam. The water is collected in the usual type of bucket having a capacity of 30 in. of rain, and is protected from frost and evaporation by an insulated casing surrounding it, which is sunk in the ground up to its junction with the conical funnel. In order to ascertain the rainfall by this instrument, the funnel is removed and the approximate depth of water in the bucket ascertained by means of the graduated cedar rod. The dipper, which is a copper receptacle holding exactly 5 in. of rain, is used to remove the water, as far as possible, the remainder being emptied out and measured in the graduated glass cylinder.

Object entry information: This instrument, which was used by the British Rainfall Organisation for over 30 years, is designed to enable observers to ascertain the most minute details of heavy rain during thunderstorms, and is not intended for yielding continuous records. With one of these instruments in London, on June 23rd, 1873, rain was ascertained to be falling for 30 seconds at the rate of 12 in. an hour, or 288 in. a day. It is the second type of storm gauge designed by Symons, and is much stronger than the earlier form. The rain passes into a copper cylinder in which is a float, which rises as the rain falls. The float has a string passing round a pulley and kept tight by a counterpoise and therefore when the float rises, the pulley turns. At the extremity of the axle of the pulley there is fixed a hand similar to the minute hand of a clock, and the size of the parts is so arranged that this hand completes a revolution when one inch of rain has fallen. Inside the case there is a very simple wheelwork, whereby another short hand, like the hour hand of a clock completes a revolution for five inches. With this gauge it is therefore quite easy to read from a window the fall of rain to hundredths of an inch, and by doing this, say every 30 sec., full details of the fall of rain can be ascertained.

Object entry information: This instrument was invented in 1879 by Mr. Sidebotham for the determination of the fall of snow. It is an eight-inch gauge with its lower part surrounded by an external jacket. Warm water is poured into the angular tube, and when the snow, with which it is never in contact, in the funnel is melted, the water is run off by the tap, and if needed, a fresh supply is added. By this arrangement any mistake from adding a wrong quantity of water is impossible. The collecting can is protected by a box with glass front, which encloses also the lower part of the gauge. The measuring jar is graduated to 0⋅50 cub. in.

Object entry information: This gauge was constructed under the directions of Dr. H. R. Mill especially for use in outlying districts, where the instrument is visited at long intervals only. It is arranged so that a large quantity of water may be collected from a 5-in. funnel, as advocated by the British Rainfall Organisation, in a receiver of 8 in. diam. The water is collected in the usual type of bucket having a capacity of 30 in. of rain, and is protected from frost and evaporation by an insulated casing surrounding it, which is sunk in the ground up to its junction with the conical funnel. In order to ascertain the rainfall by this instrument, the funnel is removed and the approximate depth of water in the bucket ascertained by means of the graduated cedar rod. The dipper, which is a copper receptacle holding exactly 5 in. of rain, is used to remove the water, as far as possible, the remainder being emptied out and measured in the graduated glass cylinder.

The rain is received by a large funnel of 9·5 in. diam., whence it is conveyed by a curved pipe to a bucket attached to one end of an arm, and counterpoised by a weight at the other end. The arm carrying the bucket and counterpoise is suspended from two pillars, and is also connected by a linked parallel movement to the pencil or pen which records the rainfall on the drum of the instrument. As the rain enters the bucket, it depresses it and draws the pencil across the moving chart to a distance corresponding to the amount of water received. When the bucket contains the correct quantity of rain (0·2 in. or 5 mm.) it automatically tips over, and the water flows away through an outlet pipe at the bottom of the gauge. After releasing its contents the bucket returns immediately to its former position, and provision has been made for the accumulation of the rain during the second or so in which the bucket is inverted, so that none is lost.

Object entry information: This has an 8-in. copper receiver, the funnel of which conveys the rain into a cylindrical vessel containing a float. Attached to this float is a vertical rod carrying a pen which, rising with the water in the receiver, records on a revolving drum the rate of rainfall. By the action of a metal plate attached to the vertical rod the pen is made to fall when it reaches the top of the paper and is thus brought into position for a continuation of the record. This work is effected by the pressure of the metal plate on a lever and the consequent bringing into position of a siphon-tube to empty the cylinder containing the rain. By a rise of the float in the vessel into which the water drawn off by its action is emptied the siphon is brought back to its original position. The paper on the drum is ruled for each 0·02 of an inch of rainfall, and the graduations range from 0·00 to 1·00.

By a rise of the float in the vessel into which the water drawn off by its action is emptied the siphon is brought back to its original position. The paper on the drum is ruled for each 0·02 of an inch of rainfall, and the graduations range from 0·00 to 1·00. The driving clock is contained within the drum and is so arranged that two-hourly records may be taken for a week.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Yeates & Son, Dublin.

Object entry information: This gauge is similar in principal to Crosley's, but consists of two distinct parts, the gauge and the recorder. The former, which is fitted with a funnel, is of square section and of 10 in. side. The rain collected by the gauge passes by the funnel to an oscillating bucket, so made and supported that the weight of a cubic inch will cause it to tilt to discharge its contents. This act of tilting is made use of to record the amount of rain received. The recorder has two dials, graduated to read to cubic inches and hundredths, and is supplied with a train of wheels, the movement of which is controlled by the armature of a pair of electro-magnets. The gauge, the recorder and a battery being connected by wires, the oscillation of the bucket completes the circuit, and the electro-magnets, acting by their armature, move forward the hand on the dial. A record of each 0·01 cub. in. of rainfall is thus obtained. The advantage of this system is, that the recording dials may be kept under cover and thus preserved from damage by exposure, while at the same time they may be readily consulted.

Object entry information: This instrument, which is of the balance pattern, was used by Dr. H. R. Mill, of the British Rainfall Organisation, at Camden Square, London, N.W., where it gave continuous records of the rainfall for more than thirty years. The rain is received by a large funnel of 9·5 in. diam., whence it is conveyed by a curved pipe to a bucket attached to one end of an arm, and counterpoised by a weight at the other end. The arm carrying the bucket and counterpoise is suspended from two pillars, and is also connected by a linked parallel movement to the pencil or pen which records the rainfall on the drum of the instrument. As the rain enters the bucket, it depresses it and draws the pencil across the moving chart to a distance corresponding to the amount of water received. When the bucket contains the correct quantity of rain (0·2 in. or 5 mm.) it automatically tips over, and the water flows away through an outlet pipe at the bottom of the gauge. After releasing its contents the bucket returns immediately to its former position, and provision has been made for the accumulation of the rain during the second or so in which the bucket is inverted, so that none is lost.

Object entry information: This has an 8-in. copper receiver, the funnel of which conveys the rain into a cylindrical vessel containing a float. Attached to this float is a vertical rod carrying a pen which, rising with the water in the receiver, records on a revolving drum the rate of rainfall. By the action of a metal plate attached to the vertical rod the pen is made to fall when it reaches the top of the paper and is thus brought into position for a continuation of the record. This work is effected by the pressure of the metal plate on a lever and the consequent bringing into position of a siphon-tube to empty the cylinder containing the rain. By a rise of the float in the vessel into which the water drawn off by its action is emptied the siphon is brought back to its original position. The paper on the drum is ruled for each 0·02 of an inch of rainfall, and the graduations range from 0·00 to 1·00. The driving clock is contained within the drum and is so arranged that two-hourly records may be taken for a week.

Object entry information: This instrument is designed for measuring the quantity of water evaporated from a surface by the action of the atmosphere. It consists of a metal reservoir, glass-graduated tube, and metal pan, which with their support form an instrument, 2 ft. 9 in. high. The glass tube is graduated, and a condensing syringe is fitted together with taps for regulating the water supply. The evaporating pan is of circular form, and has a diameter of 10 in. To prepare the apparatus for use, water is poured into it to the level of the zero of the scale. By means of the condensing syringe, the water is then forced up into the evaporating pan until the desired level is obtained, when the tap is turned. To measure the water lost by evaporation during a certain interval, the tap is turned again and the water allowed to flow back into the tube. Its height, as shown by the scale, will indicate the number of cubic inches evaporated during the time of its exposure. (See Scoffern and Lowe's ""Practical Meteorology,"" 1860.)

2. *Cirrus.*—Tufts of cirrus with extremely delicate thread-like continuations. The cirrus is moving in the direction in which the lines are lying, the tufts preceding, and the tails following.
3. *Cirrus.*—In this irregular thread-like cloud, long threads can be seen along which there occur nuclei from which other threads spread outwards more or less transversely to the main threads.
4. *Cirro-stratus.*—Part of a widely spread sheet of dense cirro-stratus, a considerable height above the cumulus clouds along the horizon. The straight edge of the cloud is noticeable.
5. *Cirro-cumulus.*—An example of the variety termed “speckle-cloud”; the globules of cloud are excessively minute toward the edges of the sheet, where they become mixed with very delicate threads of cirrus.
6. *Cirro-cumulus.*—Part of a sheet of fine globular cirro-cumulus which exhibits double undulation, the transverse system being rather irregular. This example formed very rapidly from a previously uniform cloud-sheet.
7. *Cirro-cumulus.*—Here cirro-cumulus cloudlets are shown massing together into an irregular waved form.
8. *Cirro-cumulus Lenticularis.*—A very large compound lenticular cloud-bank with several small detached single clouds. This photograph shows a wonderful sunset effect upon the rippled under surface of the cloud bank. The system of double undulation shown by the ripples is remarkable.
9. *Alto-stratus.*—The characteristic grey pall of intermediate cloud through which the sun is shining weakly. Some loose “scud” in dark ragged masses—the forerunners of the coming nimbus—may be seen moving up below the alto-stratus. This is an example wherein the alto-stratus is quite structureless.
10. *Alto-cumulus.*—An example of cloudlets without shadows; in this case the waves are sinuous instead of straight. The thinness of the cloud-layer is very obvious, especially on the left-hand side of the picture, but this was the case only at the edge of the layer, at the point where the photograph was taken. Farther to the right, the cloudlets were much denser and showed the normal shadowed appearance.
11. *Alto-cumulus.*—The most typical form of alto-cumulus, all the characteristics of that cloud-type as described in the International classification being present in this picture. The two wave-systems crossing each other (“double undulation”) are very clearly shown, and the solid character of the cloudlets is well brought out by the slight shadows upon them.
12. *Alto-cumulus Lenticularis.*—A series of these cloud-banks well depicted at sunset. The relatively great density of the central parts is plainly to be seen, as also is the comparative thinness at their edges. In the upper part of the photograph, the individual cloudlets are seen passing out of one bank and entering another. The proper method of distinguishing between cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus when they are massed into banks of this type is to examine the individual cloudlets that are nearest to the observer, for the banks themselves give very little indication of any difference when they are at all dense or very distant.
13. *Strato-cumulus.*—The typical form of this cloud. The masses are heavily shaded, and tend to fuse into each other within the sheet, while at the edges of the sheet they appear separated, so that the blue of the sky can be seen between them.
14. *Strato-cumulus.*—This is a heavier form of strato-cumulus, and is the type of cloud sheet that may cover the whole sky for days together, especially during the winter months. The cloud is dark grey with bright yellowish-white interstices where the sun is shining through the thinner parts of the sheet. The edges of the clouds are fused together; little or no blue sky can be seen between them.
15. *Cumulus.*—Typical cumulus clouds. The dome-shaped or pyramidal structure is very evident in the smaller one, and protuberances which indicate rising currents may be seen, while the flatness of the dark base which marks the level of condensation is also well shown.
16. *Cumulus (and Fracto-cumulus).*—Small cumulus clouds mixed with a considerable amount of the broken variety known as fracto-cumulus. The latter form seems to be accompanied by much turbulence and is found often in squally weather. 17. Cumulo-nimbus. - A large thunder-cloud with a very flat base from which rain is falling in the far distance. In the near front of the cloud-mass the moisture in the rising currents is condensing and spreading out into a large ""anvil"" which is fringed with false cirrus threads. Far in the rear there may be seen more false cirrus from other parts of the cloud-mass, which latter seems to be formed by the union of several cumulo-nimbus clouds. 18. Cumulo-nimbus. - This is an example showing rapidly-growing vertical columns of cloud that are uniting to form a huge thunder-cloud, of which this photograph includes less than one-fourth. A quantity of loose fracto-cumulus is floating round the main mass. 19. Cumulo-nimbus. - This hail squall cloud is moving from left to right and showers are falling from it over the sea. As the cloud moves forward the rising moist air forms in front of it a line of growing cumulus which lies round the front of the main cloud like a collar. 20. Cumulo-nimbus. - An advancing hail shower cloud, showing some growing cumulus in front. The passage of the cloud overhead was accompanied by a heavy squall with hail. 21. Nimbus. - Actually a shower falling from the nimbus-base of a large cumulo-nimbus cloud. It is impossible to photograph the typical nimbus cloud because the rain, when general, is not visible to the camera. It is only when an isolated shower shows dark against the lighter sky beyond that the rain can be shown. 22. Stratus. - This is the really typical form of stratus, a grey pall of cloud without any detail, and rendered visible only by the fact that the summit of the distant hill is immersed in the cloud, which is trailing along its flanks in the ragged masses called fracto-stratus. 23. Line Squall Front. - This shows the line of cumulus cloud losing its cumuli-form character, and beginning to show some vertical arrangement, while small wisps of condensation were moving up and down below the cloud front. 24. Nimbus with Rainbow. - A screen of rain is falling and a primary rainbow with a very faint outer secondary bow base becomes visible.",Inv. 1921-17.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

uiug.30112066809036-seq_87.jpg,218,CLOUD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN FROM THE AIR.,"Prepared in the Museum from Negatives lent by Capt. C. K. M. Douglas, R.A.F.",1918,"These photographs of clouds were taken from the air by Capt. C. K. M. Douglas, R.A.F., in 1918, and give a general indication of the appearance of the various types of clouds when viewed from above. 1. Strato-cumulus with tops at 5,000 ft. over France. - Strato-cumulus with tops at 5,000 ft. over France. In the distance clouds and haze can be seen on the horizon over England, while over the Channel it is clearer. The form of the clouds indicates turbulence, which is due in this case to heating at the surface. Immediately above the clouds the dry bulb temperature rose from 45° to 53°, and that of the wet bulb fell from 45° to 53°, the relative humidity thus suddenly falling to 23 per cent. 2. Low strato-cumulus cloud. - Low strato-cumulus cloud, with another larger one in the background. The density and great thickness of the cloud may be seen from the large dark shadow in the foreground. 3. Cumulus cloud growing up through a cloud sheet. - This photograph shows the top of a cumulus cloud growing up through a cloud sheet. The upper surface of the cloud sheet was at 8,000 ft. and the cumulus reached 11,000 ft. In this case there was no temperature inversion below 11,000 ft. The conditions being those of a cool westerly type within a depression. This combination of clouds is commonly seen, but if there is a temperature inversion above the clouds, the cumuli do not stand out so boldly, and when growing through a thin cloud sheet often break up altogether, particularly if the humidity above the clouds is low. 4. Cloud forced up from the lower air when the upper air was in a stable condition. - This illustrates the top of a cloud forced up from the lower air when the upper air was in a stable condition. Underneath are dense clouds of the strato-cumulus type, and some showers, while at 8,000 ft. the clouds were 5° F. colder than the air at that level. The cloud seen in the photograph reached an altitude of 13,000 ft., and was associated with the passage of a very small V-shaped secondary. 5. Row of large towering cumuli. - Row of large towering cumuli forming the summits of rising air columns the highest of which has risen to over 10,000 ft. 6. Large cumulus towering from 1,000 to 11,000 ft. - Large cumulus towering from 1,000 to 11,000 ft. This cloud is the same as that on the left of No. 5 and was photographed five mintues later from a distance of only two or three miles. The tops of the rising air columns are seen remarkably well in this view. 7. This photograph illustrates three cloud summits towering vertically upwards from a layer with an unstable lapse rate of temperature. It is a form not uncommon with cold west or north-west winds. There were a large number of cumulus clouds between 2,000 ft. and 3,000 ft. and some of those that reached the unstable layer above 4,000 ft. grew up very rapidly, but the tops were broken off in every case. The tops of these clouds were at an altitude of 7,800 ft. at which ""Inversion"" occurred, thereby preventing their further growth. 8. The tops of the towering cumuli of No. 7 soon became detached and are shown in this photograph. The intervening parts of the cloud pillars have evaporated and cumuli may be seen below, while in the background there is a cloud layer at an altitude of about 7,000 ft. just below the inversion. 9. - The towering cumuli of No. 7, the tops of which are shown detached in No. 8, are here seen several minutes later, when the detached fragments are dissolving, and rapidly disappearing. 10. Cumulo-nimbus (thunder-cloud) - Cumulo-nimbus (thunder-cloud), up to 20,000 ft. with dense masses of lower cloud in the foreground. The top of the cloud consisted of snow and was photographed from an altitude of 12,000 ft. 11. - A long narrow strip of cloud riddled into waves, and formed in a damp layer at 4,000 ft., the wave-length being from 150 to 200 yards. The strip lay along the current at its level, and the waves were across the current. Below may be seen a large number of small cumulus which had formed at 1,000 to 1,500 ft. from a sheet of stratus. As there was an inversion of 30° F. above the cloud but none above the clear area to south-east, it appears that there was a marked local increase of wind velocity just above the strip which gave rise to the waves. 12. - A view taken from 13,000 ft. showing snow showers from the high clouds. The lower clouds were forced up in a high bank of which the round top on the right was part. On the east side of the bank there was strato-cumulus up to 6,500 ft. with an inversion of 3° above it, while on the west there was strato-cumulus with no inversion. The bank was apparently forced up as the result of colder air arriving near the surface. 13. - Parallel rolls of cloud, two or three miles apart and approximately forty miles long, covering the Boulogne region of France, and a portion of the Channel. The rolls were in lines from south-west to north-east, but the actual motion was from west-south-west. A portion of the coast line is visible through the nearest gap. The clouds were at an altitude of 4,000 ft. to 4,500 ft. and there were other layers higher up. 14. - A nearer view of two parallel rolls of cumulus cloud. 15. - A portion of a long narrow irregular strip of cumulus photographed from 13,000 ft. The strip which was 20-30 miles long was caused by the spread of a surface breeze from north-west to west-north-west, but the clouds moved themselves with the south-west current. The cloud was evidently due to upward movement originating near the surface, as the clouds were 2° colder than the air at their level elsewhere, and were extraordinarily turbulent. 16. - A close view of the upper surface of a turbulent sheet of strato-cumulus. The top of the sheet was 5,000 ft. high and an inversion of 10° F. occurred above it, but the clouds were forced upwards in a few places in spite of this large temperature inversion. These upward currents were due partly to an unstable lapse rate of temperature in the clouds and partly to complicated wind currents near the ground. 17. - The top of a strato-cumulus cloud sheet at a height of 9,700 ft. considerably above the average height of this particular type of cloud. The cloud billows are very clearly shown, one system of waves or folds crossing the other at an angle of about 30°. There was an inversion of 3° above this cloud sheet, a thin layer at 10,000 ft. and more turbulent clouds lower down at 9,000 ft. 18. - Layer of strato-cumulus with the upper surface at an altitude of 2,500 ft. Ripples can be seen crossing the current obliquely, while a straight bank is also visible in the background. 19. Strato-cumulus sheet - Strato-cumulus sheet moving west-south-west, with the camera pointing south. The clouds were at an altitude of 4,500-5,000 ft. and there was only a very slight temperature inversion above them. 20. Strato-cumulus sheet - Strato-cumulus sheet with well-marked furrows. The waves are close together and are probably therefore across the current, but slightly oblique to it. Similar but rather larger waves are common along the current but are also frequently slightly oblique. They must be set up by a difference of wind velocity between different layers.",Inv. 1922-111.,"Continuation from previous page: [TRUE]

Object name: APPARATUS TO ILLUSTRATE THE FORMATION OF TORNADO CLOUDS.
Maker/Donor: Designed by W. H. Dines, F.R.S.
Date of creation: 1896 (Date of reference)
Object entry information: The apparatus for this experiment, as made by Mr. Dines, is of a simple and inexpensive form; that shown is of a somewhat more substantial character, to adapt it for exhibition. Three glass plates, 18 in. by 24 in., are set in each of two frames, so as to form when put together a hollow hexagonal prism. These frames are placed upon a table with their edges apart and slightly overlapping, to allow of the entry of air obliquely. A board, with a hole in its centre, in which is set a fan that can be rotated by a pair of pulleys, forms a cover to the prism, and a shallow copper evaporating pan and a burner complete the essential parts of the apparatus. If, when sufficient steam is generated from the water in the pan, the fan is rotated, a column will be produced in many respects similar to that of a Tornado cloud. The points of resemblance to the actual tornado cloud formation are stated by Mr. Dines to be:— 1. A distinct rotary motion round the centre, increasing in violence towards the centre. 2. A strong up-draft. 3. A decrease of pressure in the centre of the column. 4. The hollowness of the column. (See Q. J. R. Met. Soc., January, 1896.)

Object entry information: The original mirror was devised in 1851 and exhibited at the Great Exhibition of that year. The example here shown was designed and exhibited in 1862, its purpose being to ascertain the direction of motion of clouds. In making observations, the mirror is laid horizontally near a window and set so that the point marked North is directed to the South point of the horizon; the several points will then be reversed. The reflection of the edge of a conspicuous cloud is brought to the centre of the mirror and the point of the compass noted where it passes off the edge. This indicates the direction from which the clouds are approaching.

Object name: APPARATUS TO ILLUSTRATE THE FORMATION OF TORNADO CLOUDS.
Maker/Donor: Designed by W. H. Dines, F.R.S.
Date of creation: 1896 (Date of reference)
Object entry information: The apparatus for this experiment, as made by Mr. Dines, is of a simple and inexpensive form; that shown is of a somewhat more substantial character, to adapt it for exhibition. Three glass plates, 18 in. by 24 in., are set in each of two frames, so as to form when put together a hollow hexagonal prism. These frames are placed upon a table with their edges apart and slightly overlapping, to allow of the entry of air obliquely. A board, with a hole in its centre, in which is set a fan that can be rotated by a pair of pulleys, forms a cover to the prism, and a shallow copper evaporating pan and a burner complete the essential parts of the apparatus. If, when sufficient steam is generated from the water in the pan, the fan is rotated, a column will be produced in many respects similar to that of a Tornado cloud. The points of resemblance to the actual tornado cloud formation are stated by Mr. Dines to be:— 1. A distinct rotary motion round the centre, increasing in violence towards the centre. 2. A strong up-draft. 3. A decrease of pressure in the centre of the column. 4. The hollowness of the column. (See Q. J. R. Met. Soc., January, 1896.)

Object entry information: It consists of a disc of black glass mounted on a tripod stand which allows of accurate levelling. A vertical pointer, which can be raised or lowered by a rack and pinion motion, is attached to the circumference of the disc in such a manner that it can be rotated about the disc. A scale of millimetres engraved on the edge of the pointer gives the height of its tip above the glass surface, and on the glass surface three concentric circles are marked, the radii being in arithmetical progression.
In making an observation, the observer stations himself in such a position that the image of the cloud in the glass and the central point of the mirror are seen in the same straight line. He then rotates the pointer and adjusts its length until its tip is also brought into this straight line. This done, he moves his head so as to keep the cloud image and the tip of the pointer in coincidence, and notes the radius on which the image appears to travel. This radius marks the direction of cloud drift. A compass needle mounted below the disc enables the observer to identify the direction.
The velocity height ratio of the cloud may be determined by noting the number of seconds required for the image to travel from the centre of the mirror to the first circle, or from one circle to the next. If $a$ be the radius of the inside circle, $b$ the height of the tip of the pointer above the reflecting surface, and $t$ the time required for the cloud image to traverse the distance $a$, the value of the velocity-height ratio is given by the expression
$$\text{Velocity-height ratio} = \frac{a}{bt}$$
The instrument is fitted with a circular spirit level, which enables it to be adjusted truly horizontal.

This mirror forms the cover of a shallow brass box, in which is pivoted a compass needle whose point can be seen through a semicircular hole at the N point graduation of the mirror. This arrangement of the compass needle permits of correct orientation of the instrument.
At the south end of the mirror is hinged a jointed arm, some $2\frac{1}{2}$ in. high, with pointed end. This is made to fold over the mirror, except when observations are being made. The compass box is supported on gimbals and carries a counterpoise, the whole being supported on an upright which can be screwed to the lid of the box forming its case.
The instrument being properly oriented, a point in a cloud is brought to the centre of the mirror and the jointed arm raised to a sufficient height to allow of the observer seeing the reflection of the cloud point over its top. The direction of the cloud can then be told by the direction of displacement of its image and its velocity determined by the time taken by the cloud point in moving the definite distance between one circle to the other of the mirror.

Object entry information: This nephoscope, which is of the direct vision type, was designed at the end of the last century to facilitate the rapid determination of the direction of motion and velocity of clouds.
It consists of a brass rod, about $9 \text{ ft.}$ long, bearing at its upper end a crosspiece to which a number of vertical spikes are attached. The rod is mounted in a vertical position in such a manner that it can rotate freely, and its height is adjusted so that a fixed mark on the rod is at the level of the observer’s eye.
When using the apparatus the observer stations himself in such a position that the cloud selected for observation is seen in the same straight line as the central spike of the nephoscope. He then turns the cross-piece until the cloud appears to travel along the line of spikes while he himself remains motionless. The cross-piece will then be parallel to the line of motion of the cloud, the direction of which can be read off on a graduated circle which is provided for the

Object entry information: It consists of a disc of black glass mounted on a tripod stand which allows of accurate levelling. A vertical pointer, which can be raised or lowered by a rack and pinion motion, is attached to the circumference of the disc in such a manner that it can be rotated about the disc. A scale of millimetres engraved on the edge of the pointer gives the height of its tip above the glass surface, and on the glass surface three concentric circles are marked, the radii being in arithmetical progression.
In making an observation, the observer stations himself in such a position that the image of the cloud in the glass and the central point of the mirror are seen in the same straight line. He then rotates the pointer and adjusts its length until its tip is also brought into this straight line. This done, he moves his head so as to keep the cloud image and the tip of the pointer in coincidence, and notes the radius on which the image appears to travel. This radius marks the direction of cloud drift. A compass needle mounted below the disc enables the observer to identify the direction.
The velocity height ratio of the cloud may be determined by noting the number of seconds required for the image to travel from the centre of the mirror to the first circle, or from one circle to the next. If $a$ be the radius of the inside circle, $b$ the height of the tip of the pointer above the reflecting surface, and $t$ the time required for the cloud image to traverse the distance $a$, the value of the velocity-height ratio is given by the expression
$$\text{Velocity-height ratio} = \frac{a}{bt}$$
The instrument is fitted with a circular spirit level, which enables it to be adjusted truly horizontal.

Date of creation: 1916
Object entry information: This instrument, which was designed by Sir Horace Darwin, F.R.S., in 1916, embodies the Bennett-Pleydell “roof” principle, by means of which the altitude can be ascertained by measuring the inclination of two planes capable of rotation about horizontal and parallel axes, situated at the ends of a known base. The complete installation comprises two identical instruments known as the “Far Station” and the “Plotter Station,” and situated a known distance apart. Each instrument consists of a stationary horizontal mirror across the centre of which are drawn two fine lines at right angles to each other, sights being provided to enable the instruments to be correctly lined up with their axes parallel. The object is observed in the mirror through an eye-piece carried by a long arm having freedom of motion about two horizontal axes. By moving this arm the image is kept on the centre line of the mirror and the inclination of the arm can be read off on a graduated scale over which passes a pointer carried by the arm mounting. This reading, when combined with that of the distant station, enables the altitude of the object under observation to be ascertained. With this instrument, it is impossible to see objects overhead, while in addition it is only with great care that an accuracy of 0.1° can be attained.

Object entry information: This instrument, which is an improvement on the Darwin Gimbal Mirror, was designed by Mr. C. C. Mason in 1916, to enable an observer to see directly overhead, and embodies the Bennett-Pleydell “roof” principle. As in other height finders, two instruments comprise a complete equipment, the “Far Station” and “Plotter Station,” being identical, and consisting of a plane mirror tilting about a horizontal axis which is perpendicular to the line joining the stations. The image of the object under observation is observed in this mirror by a “Plotter” which is carried on an arm free to rotate in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis through the centre of the instrument. The “Plotter” is an eye-piece provided with two horizontal and parallel cross-wires between which the image is brought by suitably tilting the mirror with the aid of milled heads. Continual adjustment of the mirror by the observer enables the image to be kept in position mid-way between the cross-wires. The inclination of the object is given by a graduated arc on the left of the instrument and a graduated disc in the rear, which enables the angle to be read to 0.1° and estimated to 0.01°. With this instrument it is possible, while looking horizontally, to observe directly overhead and also backward, while the provision of a telescope enables the object to be picked up at a greater distance than with other instruments.

Walsh.),1916,"This instrument which depends upon the Bennett-Pleydell “roof” principle was devised in 1916 at the National Physical Laboratory by Messrs. C. C. Paterson and J. W. T. Walsh in order to enable a continuous indication of the height of an aerial target to be obtained. The complete installation consists of a height indicator, an electrical circuit and two transmitters, one of which is fitted with a plotting board and pointers. At each station, enclosed in a semicircular iron tank is a uniform resistance supported horizontally at a fixed distance below the axis of the sighting frame, and with its centre directly under this axis. Attached rigidly to the axle of this frame, and in continuation of the plane of the sighting wires, is a phosphor-bronze bar which presses against the horizontal resistance. In this way the distance between the centre of the resistance and the point of contact of the bar is always proportional to the cotangent of the angle of elevation of the sighting frame. Thus if it be arranged that there is a constant current passing through the resistance, the difference of electrical potential between the bar and the centre of the resistance is also proportional to this quantity. By means of a local battery, voltmeter and regulating rheostat, the voltage drop across a given length of resistance is maintained at the same constant value at both home and distant stations. The distances between the axes of rotation of the sighting frame and the horizontal tracks of the phosphor-bronze bars on the resistances are also the same at both stations, so that by connecting line conductors between the stations in such a manner as to put the two voltage differences in series, a milliammeter with a suitable swamping resistance in the circuit gives at once a reading proportional to the difference of the cotangents of the two sighting angles. It follows that in order to obtain a direct reading of height, the instrument must be provided with a reciprocal scale. For the purpose of increasing the range, two scales are provided; one from 1,600 to 5,000 ft., and the other from 5,000 to 20,000 ft. The more open scale is brought into operation by pressing a key switch which normally short-circuits a shunt to the moving coil of the instrument. The series resistance of the milliammeter is variable, and is so adjusted in relation to (i) the actual voltages employed at the two stations, (ii) the sensitivity of the milliammeter, and (iii) the ratio of the base length to the vertical distance between the axes of the sighting frames and their respective resistances, that a given base length corresponds with a definite series resistance for all instruments. Corresponding values are tabulated in the instrument box, and so any instrument can be used with any length of base by suitably adjusting the series resistance. The chief errors to which the instrument is liable are (i) leakage in the insulation of the main conductors between the stations, and (ii) change of resistance of these conductors with change of temperature. On this latter account these conductors are required to be as heavy as possible so that their resistance may be properly swamped by the series resistance of V. (See Pat. Specn.

Dines, F.R.S., for use with registering balloons (*ballons-sondes*), produces a record of air pressure and temperature from which the altitude can be computed. It has been adopted by the Meteorological Offices of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, and, with some modifications, by that of India. The meteorograph consists essentially of a small aneroid box mounted in a light frame, one side of the frame carrying a small thin plate on which the record is made, and the other side the recording pens. The plate is electro-plated with copper, and then silver, thereby producing a surface which is free from scratches, and which is not susceptible to corrosion. The thermograph depends for its action on the relative contraction of a strip of thin German silver as compared with the invar steel rod on which it is supported. This motion is multiplied by a lever mounted across the ends of the strips, and communicated to a scratching point, which writes upon the metal record. To facilitate measurement, a second pointer is attached to the invar rod. The fall of pressure is determined by the expansion of an aneroid box, which moves the recording point over the metal record in a direction at right angles to that given by change of temperature. During the descent of the instrument, the points are lifted clear of the plate by an automatic arrangement at a point where the pressure is about 0.95 mgd. per sq. cm. (28 in. of mercury). In this way, the last 500 m. of the descent is lost, but a record is obtained which is free from blur. The instrument is protected by a bright metal case, and is well ventilated, so as to eliminate the effect of solar radiation. Before the ascent, the meteorograph is calibrated by causing the pen to make marks upon the metal record corresponding with known temperatures and pressures, over the range required.

Object entry information: eight ascents between 1862 and 1866, to investigate the variation of temperature, humidity, magnetic force and electric potential. In 1877 Secretan was the first to send up india-rubber balloons or pilot balloons when investigating the change of wind direction with height, and determining the heights of clouds. During the four years commencing 1875, Tissandier ascended on several occasions in free balloons while between 1888 and 1901 Glaisher’s work was repeated by Berson. Later experiments with free manned balloons have been chiefly con-fined to lower altitudes and principally for the verification of results obtained by other means. In 1883-5 Archibald used kites with steel piano-wire to obtain the wind velocity, while about this time McA die repeated Franklin’s experiments in America. In 1890 Eddy re-designed the kite, and in 1894 sent up the first kite to carry a con-tinuously recording instrument. *Ballon-sondes* carrying continuously recording instruments had been proposed in 1809, and also in 1873, but were not actually used until 1893, when Hermite employed a varnished paper balloon, and later one of gold-beater’s skin, a silk one being eventually used in 1894. In 1896 the International Meteoro-logical Conference organised a series of ascents of *ballons-sondes* simultaneously in different countries, which were extended to include Austria and Italy in 1898, Belgium 1899, and England in 1901, while in 1898 the kite and kite-balloon were included in the apparatus of all the principal observatories. After Glaisher’s work in 1869, captive balloons were little used on account of their tendency to oscillate and rotate, until Siegsfeld and Parseval produced their kite-balloon which was used at Strasburg in 1898, since which it has been employed regularly by the Prussian Meteorological Service.

In 1901, Rotch, and in the following year Dines, Berson and Elias, experimented with kites over the sea, while in 1902-3 Teisserenc de Bort, at Hald, in Jutland, employed kites night and day whenever possible over a period of nine months, and in addition investigated the conditions of the upper air by means of a large number of *ballons-sondes*. In 1904, Hergesell made a number of kite ascents in the Atlantic, as did Teisserenc de Bort and Rotch in 1905-6.

Subsequently excellent work has been done in this country by Dines, Cave, Ley and others, the results of which are published in the Weekly Weather Report by the Meteorological Office.

Kites have now been superseded by aeroplanes and *ballon-sondes*; pilot balloons are used regularly with theodolites for determining the direction and velocity of the wind at various heights. Observations are also made with *ballons-sondes* on days appointed by international arrangement and also in the course of investigations on the upper air in many countries.

It differs considerably from the surveying theodolite, although constructed on the same general principle. The telescope tube is in two parts, which are at right angles to one another, a prism being placed at the right angle to deflect the rays of light from the object-glass towards the eyepiece. The tube in which the eyepiece is mounted lies in a horizontal plane, and rotates about the vertical axis of the instrument so that, at all altitudes of the balloon, the observer is always looking in a horizontal direction. As the balloon ascent may continue for half an hour, such an arrangement eliminates the discomfort that would otherwise ensue with a straight telescope tube when the observed angular altitudes were considerable. The telescope is set at infinity focus, for after the first half-minute the distance of the balloon from the observer is such that a fixed focus instrument is practicable. If only one theodolite is employed, the path of the balloon can only be determined when its rate of ascent is known; but if two theodolites are employed, preferably separated by a base line of considerable length, the available readings suffice to fix the position of the balloon in space at any observation, and hence to lay down its path.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed by Teisserenc de Bort for collecting a sample of air at some definite height during the ascent of an unmanned balloon. The instrument consists essentially of a Bourdon barometer tube, to which is connected a lever which makes contact with a metal stud when the balloon has ascended to a certain height. A small weight is released electrically and drops on to the finely drawn-out end of a sealed and exhausted glass tube, into which air is thus admitted. As the balloon ascends further, the barometer lever makes contact with another stud, and this causes a current to pass round a coil of platinum wire which is wound round the neck of the glass tube. The heat thus generated enables the neck of the tube to be sealed, enclosing a sample of air.

Object entry information: In the single theodolite method the rate of ascent of the balloon is computed from its weight and free lift, so that the height of the balloon is known at any instant during the ascent. If H is the height of the balloon, E is the angular altitude, and A is the azimuth measured from north, then the components of the displacement of the balloon towards the north and towards the east of the observer are, respectively, H cot E cos A and H cot E sin A. The slide-rule is arranged for the rapid computation of these quantities over a series of regularly increasing values of H, combined with known values of E and A. In a series of balloon observations, the observed angles change slowly, and, as the trigonometrical scales are fixed, the cursors which indicate the angles are only displaced slightly from one setting to the next.

Object entry information: This form of meteorograph was designed by Teisserenc de Bort to record humidity, temperature and pressure in the upper air simultaneously, and for this purpose was used the Observatoire de Trappes. The record is made by three pens which register upon a cylindrical drum revolved by clockwork. The upper pen, which records the humidity, is actuated by the expansion or contraction of a length of hair, the motion being magnified considerably by a lever. The middle pen records the temperature and is controlled by a bi-metallic thermometer which consists of a compound strip of brass and steel, the curvature of which varies with temperature. A Bourdon barometer tube serves to operate the lower pen, which records the barometric pressure.

It is a baro-thermo-hygro-anemograph, the barometer of which is a large double aneroid with steel boxes. The thermometer consists of two annular Bourdon tubes of very thin steel filled with alcohol, and the hygrometer consists of two bundles of hair. The thermometer tubes and hygrometer hairs are enclosed in a polished tube open at both ends. The anemometer originally used was a small instrument of the Robinson cup pattern, operating through an electro-magnet on a small hammer and recording on the drum in steps. In later patterns the anemometer was replaced by an Assmann anemometer, designed on the Woltmann fly wheel anemometer principle. It consists of an eight-bladed fan fitting into the end of the aspiration tube and operating through a train of cogwheels on the marking pen. The instrument when used with the anemometer is suspended by a wire some distance below the kite to avoid any disturbing effect due to the latter.

Object entry information: This instrument, designed by Mr. W. H. Dines, F.R.S., for use with kites, furnishes a record of pressure, temperature and humidity in the free air up to 10,000 ft. A circular chart of 12 in. diam. is carried on a flat piece of thin wood, and turns uniformly on a stout brass pin. The record is made by three pens, which from left to right indicate humidity, pressure and temperature, respectively. The hygrograph, which measures the humidity, is actuated by the expansion and contraction of 6 in. of hair, the motion being multiplied eight times by a lever which moves over a scale $\frac{5}{8}$ in. in length. The altitude, or more strictly the atmos pheric pressure, is shown by the expansion of a single aneroid box of $2 \cdot 7$ in. diam., the motion being multiplied about 30 times by a single lever. The arrangement of the thermograph is similar, the pen being actuated by a small aneroid box in exactly the same manner. In this case, the aneroid box is filled with alcohol, and is in communication with $4 \cdot 5$ ft. of thin copper tube $0 \cdot 125$ in. diam., arranged in the form of a coil under the flat wooden frame. In an improved model of this instrument, and arrangement for recording the velocity of the wind has been added, in which the wind pressure is measured by means of its action on a small celluloid sphere attracted by a thread. The meteorograph is secured in the middle of the kite by four strings, which run from the corners of the instrument to points near the ends of the two long bamboos of the kite. (See ""Symons' Magazine,"" July 1904, Vol. XXXIX., and March 1906.)

Object entry information: These were designed by W. H. Dines, F.R.S., for recording pressure, temperature and wind-force in the free air up to 10,000 ft. The instruments by which records are taken are attached to a light board, 12 in. by 15 in., which is suspended to a box kite. On the board is also a circular sheet of paper ruled for recording purposes, and a small clock for rotating the paper. The apparatus for air-pressure and wind-force are set on one side of the clock, those for temperature and humidity on the other, and the writing apparatus is carried at the ends of light levers in connection with the four instruments. The pressure instrument consists of an ordinary aneroid box, to the centre of which is fixed a knife-edge which, as pressure is reduced, pushes forward the lever which carries the pen. On any rise of pressure a spring keeps the lever in contact with the knife-edge so that it follows the backward movement of the aneroid case. The temperature instrument is formed of a long spiral of copper tubing which is set at the back of board. This tube opens into a small aneroid box containing alcohol. To the centre of this box is fixed a knife-edge which acts on the recording lever in much the same way as in the air-pressure instrument. The humidity apparatus consists of a bundle of hairs at the back of the board, the elongation and shortening of which move the recording lever in one direction or the other over the dial. For wind-force there is at the back of the instrument an arm to which can be attached a celluloid ball of 3 in. diam. and 100 grns. weight. This ball is hung at the end of 40 ft. of fine sewing-cotton and its movements set in action the writing-lever in connection with the arm. The board of the meteorograph is secured to the middle of the kite by the four cords at its corners, the junction being near the ends of the two long bamboos.

The exceptional clearness of the atmosphere during the coal strike of that year is shown by the third record, which was taken on May 17th–18th. In order to obtain the records a fixed volume of air is drawn at regular intervals through the filtering paper which is of sufficiently fine texture to collect on its surface the whole of the suspended impurities in the air, leaving it in the form of a discoloured patch. The amount of impurity is measured by the degree of discolouration and is estimated by comparison with a series of standard tints. (See Pat. Spec. No. 8725, 1916.)

Maker/Donor: Lent by John Smyth, Esq., Jun.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This was the first ozonometer designed by Smyth in 1864, for determining the quantity of ozone in the atmosphere, in connection with the bleaching of linen. It consists of a glass-lined brass tube one end of which is open, while the other end is closed except for a glass delivery tube of 0.4 in. diam., carrying a large glass stopcock to admit air. A brass cap is provided for closing the open end of the tube, within which is a thick glass disc bearing a wooden frame and grooved for an india-rubber band which holds a test paper in position across its mouth. In this way the test paper is held across the entrance tube and at a distance of about 0.1 in. from it. A small tube from the other extremity of the box communicates with a large aspirator. The amount of ozone is judged by its action on the test paper which after exposure is removed and compared with standard tints forming a scale. These papers are prepared in various ways, the substance used by Schönbein being iodide of starch. (See Brit. Assoc. Report, 1865, ii., p. 37.)

The stars of the Ursa Major are seen on the photographs and are somewhat deformed owing to the short focus of the lens. The altitude of this phenomenon was between 90 and 100 km. 9. These fine auroral rays were photographed from Oscarsborg (a) and Bygdo (b) simultaneously at 10.6 a.m. on 4th March, 1920, the two stations being about 26 km. apart. The star Aldebaran is seen near the middle of the pictures, and the Pleiades to the right. The lower extremities of the rays were at an altitude of approximately 120 km. 10. This short auroral curtain was photographed at Kongsberg (a) and Bygdo (b) in the early morn of 23rd March, 1920, the base line having a length of 64 km. The exposure was 8 seconds. The stars Castor and Pollux are near the middle, and Jupiter to the left. The right edge of the curtain stretched from an altitude of 108 km. down to one of 82 km.

Object entry information: These photographs, which were taken in the desert at or near Kantara on the Suez Canal, illustrate the formation of a mirage caused by atmospheric refraction due to the vertical distribution of temperature near the ground. The first photograph, taken at Kantara on 5th April, 1920, about one and a half hours before sunset, is reproduced for comparison with the second one, no mirage being visible. The foreground slopes away gently for a distance of two or three miles until it reaches a low ridge of sand a few feet high, capped by a series of low bushes. Beyond this the ground slopes upwards, in a series of ridges or undulations, to the horizon which is 15 to 20 miles distant. The light colour of the first ridge is probably due to a thin deposit of salt from a former inundation. The second photograph is one of the same landscape taken about an hour before noon on 21st April, and shows what appears to be a complete reflection of the bush-covered ridge, the angular distance between the bushes and their images being between 1 and 3.5 min. of arc. It will be noticed that there is also an enlargement of the bushes in a vertical direction as compared with the first photograph. The third photograph was taken on 8th February, 1920, at El Kab, four miles north of Kantara, the landscape in this case being a level stretch of sand extending between 5 and 10 miles, beyond which is a low range of sandhills forming the horizon. In this photograph the tops of these sandhills can be seen clearly and underneath them there appears to be inserted a layer of sky or water, in which is an apparent reflection of the hills, which now look like a series of islands in the sea. The mirage ends abruptly in a straight and well defined boundary the position of which is governed by the limiting angles at which rays may be refracted to the observer.

Object entry information: This map was produced by Halley in 1686, when he explained the cause of the trade winds and monsoons observed over the sea, in the region of the tropics, an explanation which is still accepted almost without modification. Halley regarded the previously accepted theory that the trade winds are produced by the retardation of the atmosphere relative to the rotation of the earth as being insufficient, and attributed their origin to the temperature difference between the equator and the poles and to the earth's rotation. According to Halley, the strongly heated air in the equatorial zone rises into the higher regions of the atmosphere, and is replaced by two in-flowing currents of air from the temperate regions to the north and south. Halley also demonstrated the existence of the counter-trade winds and put forward a correct explanation of the monsoons. In the chart the wind direction is indicated by broken lines, the wind travelling along each of these small lines from the pointed end towards the end which is broader. (See Phil.

While this work was in progress two storms of exceptional intensity passed over the British Isles, on 25th October, 1859, and on 1st November, 1859, the former of which is known as the Royal Charter Storm. This chart which indicates the conditions at 9 a.m. on 26th October, shows the storm directly over the British Isles, with the minimum pressure region over the northern portion of England. The depression has passed over Ireland where the pressure is increasing and has already reached a fairly high value, while the temperature is also rising. The wind can be seen in general to be circulating in an anti-clockwise direction about the centre of the depression, while the location of clouds, rain, and snow, is greatly facilitated by the manner in which their presence is indicated. Pressures and temperatures are not indicated by isobars and isotherms, but by thick and thin lines whose ordinates above certain fixed lines of latitude give a measure of the pressure and temperature respectively.

In the chart the wind direction is indicated by broken lines, the wind travelling along each of these small lines from the pointed end towards the end which is broader. (See Phil.

Object entry information: This chart was one of a series produced in connection with the great Exhibition of 1851, and may be regarded as a sequel to the work of Glaisher and the Electric Telegraph Company in 1849, when 30 meteorological stations were organised, while on 14th June, 1849, the Daily News published for these stations the direction and force of the wind, and the state of the weather. From 8th August to 11th October, 1851, the Electric Telegraph Company exhibited at the great Exhibition a large chart on which each day was indicated the state of the weather, the barometric pressure, and the direction of the wind. The winds are represented by arrows, and the pressures are given in figures, while the weather is indicated by letters.

Date of creation: 1863 (Suggested method); 1861 (Weather studied)
Object entry information: Sir Francis Galton, in 1863, suggested a new method of publishing meteorological observations, to facilitate the construction of synoptic charts. Employing this method he studied the weather during December, 1861, over the greater portion of Europe, plotting three charts for each day, from which he deduced the existence of high pressure regions which he called “anti-cyclones.” In these charts of barometric pressure, a pressure of 29·20 or less is indicated by black disc, and between 29·21 and 29·45 by a black star. A black circle with a centre indicates between 29·46 and 29·70, and one without centre between 29·71 and 29·95, while red circle without centre represents a pressure between 29·96 and 30·20 and with a red centre from 30·21 to 30·45. Pressures from 30·46 to 30·70 are indicated by a red star, and above that value by a red disc. On the chart for 1st December, the barometric depression is seen to be travelling from west to east, while the winds are circulating around the minimum pressure region in an anti-clockwise direction, and the temperature in general is high. The chart for 2nd December shows a wind circulating in a clockwise direction round a high pressure region, accompanied by a considerable fall of temperature. Galton, in discussing these examples, gives the first description of anti-cyclones, and indicates that the ascending current of a cyclone is replaced by a descending one in an anti-cyclone.

Clement Ley, in 1872, traced the formation, development and subsequent disappearance of cyclones, with the aid of charts, and enunciated for the first time the laws of the winds in the upper air, which he studied by observation of the higher clouds. This chart illustrates the spiral motion of the wind around a depression, and shows how the wind direction is inclined to the isobars. As a result of his observations, Ley stated that, in general, centres of depression move in winter towards the south-east, and in summer towards the north-east, a cause of this being that in winter the isotherms lie in a north and south direction, while in summer they are directed from south-east to north-east. Ley also showed that rainfall is always the first cause of the formation of a barometric depression, and demonstrated in a manner similar to Möhn, that the condensation of water vapour to the east of a depression is the cause of its motion in that direction, while he also concluded that in general the upper currents of the atmosphere move away from the regions of minimum barometric pressure and converge towards the high pressure areas.

As a result of his observations, Ley stated that, in general, centres of depression move in winter towards the south-east, and in summer towards the north-east, a cause of this being that in winter the isotherms lie in a north and south direction, while in summer they are directed from south-east to north-east. Ley also showed that rainfall is always the first cause of the formation of a barometric depression, and demonstrated in a manner similar to Möhn, that the condensation of water vapour to the east of a depression is the cause of its motion in that direction, while he also concluded that in general the upper currents of the atmosphere move away from the regions of minimum barometric pressure and converge towards the high pressure areas.

Object entry information: 11 and 19 miles per hour, usually towards the east. The diameter of a depression is seldom less than 600 miles, while the air moves round it in an anti-clockwise direction, but at an angle to the isobars, while in a high pressure region the circulation is clockwise. Any variation of pressure is accompanied by a temperature variation in the reverse direction, so that the temperature rises as a depression approaches and falls as the depression passes. (See Trans.

Object entry information: In 1868, Buchan published a paper on the storms of the Northern Hemisphere from March 13th to 22nd, 1859, which he illustrated by several charts. During this period six storms were observed, which are indicated on the chart exhibited by letters A to F, while in three cases the track of the storm is also given. From these charts and tables of observations, Buchan verified his conclusions of 1865, and in addition determined that in a depression the large mass of air moving round the centre, gradually approaches the centre where it rises to a high altitude, and disperses, forming currents which are superposed over those of the lower layers. The spiral motion of the air towards the barometric centre he explains as being due to the earth's rotation. (See Journ. Scot. Met. Soc., October, 1868.)

It is a modification of an earlier form of polymeter, the humidity scale of which has been re-calculated and extended. The thermometer is made of Jena glass and carries on the left the usual Fahrenheit temperature scale, while the scale on the right indicates the maximum vapour pressure in millimetres of mercury corresponding to the temperature reading. The hygrometer consists of a bundle of human hairs securely clamped at one end, and about 7 in. long, which controls the motion of a pointer over a dial bearing two graduated scales. The lower of these scales indicates the relative humidity of the atmosphere surrounding the polymeter, while the upper scale indicates the temperature difference between the existing atmospheric temperature and the dew point in degrees F. In order that the instrument may be useful in indicating the humidity of artificially dried atmospheres, such as over-heated rooms, in which the relative humidity is less than 30 per cent., the relative humidity scale has been modified in accordance with results obtained by Gay Lussac and extended to indicate from 0 per cent. to 100 per cent. The human hair if moistened with water does not expand to its maximum length as it does when exposed to a completely saturated atmosphere, but only to an extent equivalent to a relative humidity of 95 per cent., thereby furnishing a ready means of correcting the instrument.

Its action is based on known meteorological laws, with certain modifications suggested by long continued observation of weather conditions and changes. The forecaster consists of two concentric discs of brass, each capable of rotation irrespective of the other, while the larger one is surrounded by an annular ring of brass, within which it is free to rotate. This annular ring carries engraved (6184)

Object entry information: scales for barometer height and wind direction, while the larger disc is provided with graduations indicating a falling, steady, or rising barometer in summer and winter. Upon this large disc are also engraved the forecasts, arranged radially so that the appropriate one is visible through a radial slot or window in the smaller disc. In using the instrument, the wind direction and the height and state of the barometer are noted, after which the arrow on the larger disc, indicating the state of the barometer, falling, steady or rising, is set to the correct direction of the wind. The barometer pointer is now set to the barometer scale at the top of the instrument, when the forecast appears at the window. In the event of two forecasts being visible, a combination of the two should be taken. (See Pat. Specn. No. 6276, A.D. 1915.)

The surface is divided from left to right into twelve sections representing the months of the year, and in a perpendicular direction into twenty-four sections corresponding to the hours of the day. In this way the surface is divided into a series of rectangles, each one of which represents by its height above the datum level the mean average temperature during a month at a certain time of the day. From the surface it is easily seen that at Göttingen the maximum mean temperature occurs between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. during July and August, and the minimum at about 3 a.m. in January.
