In the course of some experiments with his Induction Balance, Prof. Hughes found that if a circuit was formed by joining up in series a battery, a microphone, and one of the coils of his balance, any interruption of the circuit was accompanied by a disturbance which became audible in a telephone receiver connected to another microphone, even when the two circuits were widely separated and there was no direct connection between them. Prof. Hughes carried out a great many experiments, many of which were witnessed by eminent men of science, but whereas Prof. Hughes was convinced that they were due to some form of conduction between the two circuits, his friends eventually came to the conclusion that they could all be accounted for by the known laws of electro-magnetic induction. It is now certain that in these experiments, Hughes, like Edison in 1875, was dealing with true Hertzian waves such as now used in wireless telegraphy, and that he was unwittingly employing for their detection the coherer method of reception which was first deliberately used for this purpose by Lodge in 1889.

Edison experimented with a glow lamp having a metal plate sealed into the exhausted bulb and a carbon filament rendered incandescent by a direct electric current. He discovered that if the metal plate was connected to the positive terminal of the filament by an external wire, a feeble electric current flowed through it, whereas hardly any current flowed when the plate was connected to the negative terminal. Mr. Edison himself gave no explanation of this effect. It was assumed in 1889 that there was an emission of negatively electrified carbon atoms from the filament, but in 1899 Sir J. J. Thomson showed that they were particles of negative electricity, now called electrons. These are projected at a high speed from the incandescent filament and attracted to a positively electrified metal plate sealed into the bulb. The effect is now known as Thermionic Emission. In 1889 Prof. Fleming commenced a systematic investigation of the Edison effect, and constructed for this purpose the series of vacuous bulbs lettered A to I. Bulb C was constructed in order to prove that thermionic emission takes place in the case of an incandescent platinum wire as well as in that of an incandescent carbon filament. Bulbs D, E and F were used to test how far from the filament the emitted particles could travel to a positively electrified metal plate, and whether they could travel round an elbow-tube or only in straight lines. It was found that the thermionic current became weaker as the distance between the filament and plate (or ""anode"") was increased. Bulbs G and H were used to investigate the emission from various parts of the filament, and it was shown to be prevented by enclosing the carbon filament in a glass tube. In bulb I provision was made for the interposition of a mica plate between the anode and filament in order to find out if the transfer of negative electricity was thereby stopped. It was found that this was so. Bulbs J, K, L and M are samples of the two electrode thermionic valves which were the outcome of the foregoing experiments. Electrons are evaporated from an incandescent carbon or tungsten filament and attracted to the anode which is positively charged by means of a battery. The space between the filament and anode thus allows negative electricity to pass in one direction, but not in the opposite, and it can therefore convert the high-frequency alternating current set up in a wireless receiver into a direct current (i.e., rectify it).

Branly, of Paris, made the extremely important observation that an electric spark at a distance had the power of suddenly changing the electric conductivity of loose masses of powdered conductors. He showed that a tube of metallic filings loosely packed between metal plugs might be a conductor of very high resistance when the metallic filings were loosely arranged, but that if a discharge from a Leyden jar was made in the vicinity, the conductivity of the metallic powder was suddenly increased. Similar observations had been made previously by other experimenters (see No. 21), but this was the first time that a careful study was made of the phenomenon. In 1894, Sir Oliver Lodge conducted some experiments using the actual tubes shown, which were similar to those of Branly. Each consists of a glass tube filled loosely with coarse filings or borings of iron contained between two metal plugs. Sir Oliver Lodge noticed that the change of resistance of the tube was proportional to the energy of electric radiation from a source of given frequency. He arranged an electro-magnetic vibrating arrangement (shown in one specimen) to produce mechanical agitation, and so destroy the incipient cohesion caused by the electric radiation. A similar arrangement was adopted by Popoff in Russia and Marconi in Italy. One of these tubes, found to have a resistance of 2,500 ohms in the sensitive state.

An endless band, consisting of a number of strands of insulated iron wire, passes over two pulleys which are made to rotate slowly by clockwork. Near to a part of the band two horseshoe magnets are fixed with similar poles adjacent, and at this point, where a large number of lines of force pass into the band, the latter passes through a tube surrounded by two coils. The inner coil is connected with the aerial and earth wires, and the outer coil with the telephone receiver. This arrangement of magnets and coils is duplicated at another point of the band so that two telephones may be used or the coils may be connected in series, which often increases the strength of the signals. As the band travels slowly through the coils, the lines of force are drawn out in the direction of its motion owing to the retentivity of the iron, but when oscillatory currents arrive from the aerial circuit these lines are freed and a rapid change takes place in the magnetic field.

34,41,1916-73,Whole,N/A,SILICON CRYSTAL,donated,SILICON CRYSTAL,"The use of crystal detectors in receiving circuits renders it possible to “detect” the high-frequency currents set up in the receiving aerial, by completely rectifying the alternating current into a current whose mean value is no longer zero, and then using a polarised electro-magnetic indicator (a telephone). This is due to the fact that with certain minerals, usually crystalline, the resistance to the flow of electricity across the contact between a piece of metal, and a piece of the mineral, or between two pieces of different minerals, depends largely on the value of the current, even when the current is extremely small, and does not obey Ohm's law. Thus the P.D. current characteristic has a pronounced curvature, and consequently if an alternating E.M.F., whose mean value is zero, is applied to the crystal the mean value of the resulting current is not zero. This current is spoken of as the “rectified current.” The specimen shown is a silicon crystal, the contact being made between a crystal of silicon and steel. It is now mounted in a locket, but it was formerly used in the wireless installation of the cargo vessel S.S. “Nonsuch.” This was the first British cargo vessel to carry a wireless installation, and on September 16th, 1910, when off the coast of Morocco, she received messages from the North Foreland Station, a distance of 940 nautical miles.

46,1904-05,1904-65,Whole,N/A,,,APPARATUS TO ILLUSTRATE THE PRINCIPLES OF SPARK TELEGRAPHY,"The apparatus here shown represents a transmitting and a receiving group constructed for demonstration purposes in the early days of wireless telegraphy. The transmitter comprises a small induction coil, to the secondary terminals of which two adjustable metal spheres are connected: a Morse key is connected in the primary circuit. The primary condenser consists of alternate sheets of tinfoil and paper, and is joined across the interrupter contacts, its functions being to reduce the break spark, and to demagnetise the core quickly. The intermittent high voltages generated in the secondary coil produce charges on the secondary condenser, setting up a state of electric strain across the gap. When the gap is set to such a width that the maximum charge on the condenser reaches a value sufficient to break down the insulation of the air, a current will flow across the gap. After a small fraction of time the discharge equalises the potentials, causing the electric strain to be removed; ultimately the condenser again charges up, and discharges across the gap, but in the opposite direction. By this means, electro-magnetic waves are generated, and radiated through the aether, the waves being heavily damped, owing to the losses in the circuit. The receiver consists of two long strips of copper foil arranged in the same line, but separated by a coherer. This consists of a narrow glass tube, exhausted of air, having two plugs of silver attached to platinum wires. Between these plugs is a space partly filled with a metallic powder, composed of 95 per cent. nickel and 5 per cent. silver. In its normal state this presents a high resistance to the passage of an electric current. When electric oscillations are set up in the coherer circuit, the resistance falls very considerably owing to an apparent cohesion of the filings, and a current can pass of sufficient strength to operate a relay. The resistance remains at its low value until the tube is tapped and decohered. The tapper consists of an electro-magnet having vibrating armature arranged in circuit with the coherer and battery. Immediately the coherer becomes a conductor the armature is pulled down, thereby completing another circuit containing battery and electric bell, the clapper of which communicates vibration to the metallic powder. The moment the electro-magnetic radiation ceases, the final blow of the clapper renders the coherer a non-conductor, thus breaking the bell circuit.",,,"[{'name': 'Inv.', 'role': 'inventor'}]",,1904-05,tinfoil;paper;copper foil;silver;nickel,,"The apparatus here shown represents a transmitting and a receiving group constructed for demonstration purposes in the early days of wireless telegraphy.

The instrument takes 5 amperes at 100 volts D.C., and is designed to charge a .01 mfd. condenser to a sparking voltage of 11,000 at a spark frequency of about 600 per second. The instrument consists of a motor-driven interrupter and two transformers, (a) the high-tension transformer, the secondary of which is connected to the spark gap, .01 mfd. condenser, etc., (b) the “buffer transformer,” the secondary of which is connected to a .4 mfd. condenser. The primary windings of the transformers are connected in series with the interrupter. The interrupter consists of a disc of insulating material, mounted on the shaft of the motor, with nine equally spaced copper segments embedded in its outer surface. The copper segments serve to make and break contact with two copper brushes rubbing on the periphery of the disc. When the interrupter is rotated at the correct speed, 4,000 r.p.m., and the signalling key in the supply circuit is closed, the E.M.F.s induced at “make” in the secondary of the “buffer transformer,” set that circuit into a state of continuous oscillation. The interrupter is adjusted so that it opens and closes the primary circuit at moments when the “buffer” secondary current is passing through zero values, so that one half oscillation occurs during “make” and the other half oscillation during “break.” The coupling between these two circuits during “make” causes that half-wave to be higher in amplitude and shorter in duration than the free half-wave during “break.” The oscillation of energy in the “buffer” secondary circuit induces E.M.Fs. in the primary assisting the supply circuit at the moment of closing the circuit and opposing it at the instant of “break.” The primary current, therefore, rises sharply to a maximum and then falls to zero again in time with the secondary oscillation. The interruption of the primary circuit, therefore, takes place when the supply current is at zero value, and there is then little tendency to spark. The effect of the high-tension transformer sets up a high E.M.F. in its secondary at each “make,” which is communicated to the condenser and spark gap connected to the high-tension circuit circuit occurs while the primary is closed and not when it is opened, as in the case in the ordinary Ruhmkorff induction coil.",,,"[{'name': 'W.

De Forest had been working on the simple rectifying diode of Fleming, which he re-named the “Audion”; but he afterwards transferred this appellation to the three-electrode tube which is his special contribution to the subject. The third electrode consists of a metal strip of wire bent into the form of a grid, and situated between the filament and the anode. It serves as a control element whereby the current between them is influenced. The revolutionary possibilities of the instrument are bound up in the almost complete absence of inertia effects, and in the dependence of the anode current on the potential existing at any time between the grid and the filament. By making appropriate use of these properties the valve may be used as a detector of high frequency currents, as was the original Fleming valve, or as a medium for the amplification of high or low frequency currents, or as a means of generating undamped oscillations. Photographs of two instruments embodying these latter functions, designed by De Forest in 1914, are exhibited.

75,,"1924-219, S.M. 2154",Whole,N/A,LIEBEN-REISZ RELAY,loaned,Gas Relay,"Plate 8 (b). Lent by The Right Hon. Sir Henry Norman, Bart. At about the same time that L. de Forest was investigating his three-electrode valve, Messrs. Lieben and Reisz were experimenting in Vienna with a similar appliance. They named this a ""Gas Relay,"" and in its final form it was fully described in November, 1913. Like the Audion, it could be used as a generator of electrical oscillations, but it was intended to be used mainly as an amplifier of speech currents, and it was the first triode to be definitely so employed. The appearance of this tube aroused fresh interest in the whole subject, and the Lieben-Reisz Relay shares with the Audion and the Fleming valve the distinction of having brought about a revolution in methods of electrical communication. The tube differs from the Audion in having an oxide-coated filament, a type which has since been widely used in ""dull-emitter"" valves. The principle is due to Wehnelt, who, in 1904, discovered that strongly heated oxides, particularly those of calcium and barium, emit electrons at very low voltages. The cathode in this case is a platinum strip 1 metre in length and 0.02 mm. in width, wound in a zigzag form on a glass support, and is coated in the manner described above. The grid is a circular aluminium plate perforated with holes about 3.5 mm. in diameter, while the anode is a short spiral of 2 mm. aluminium wire, placed at the apex of the tube. The cathode is brought to a bright red heat at a temperature of about 1,000 deg. C. by a battery of 30 volts; the necessary anode voltage being 220. In the early experiments it was found difficult to obtain a uniform discharge owing to variation of the gas pressure inside the tube. It was therefore decided to replace the gas discharge with a vapour discharge by introducing mercury vapour inside the tube, constancy of pressure being obtained by means of a small quantity of mercury amalgam placed in the side tube.

76,8,1924-200,Whole,N/A,PLIOTRON VALVE,loaned,Pliotron Valve,"This is a thermionic tube of much historical importance. In all the valves which preceded the pliotron a relatively large amount of residual gas was present in the bulb. This had a very considerable influence in supplying positive ions within it, which tended to neutralise the space charge effect of the electron currents between cathode and anode, and enabled comparatively large currents to be passed at low potentials. But the presence of such an amount of gas as is indicated by a pressure of 1/10,000 mm. of mercury, led to great instability, so that the results obtained with these gas tubes were often most uncertain. Until 1915, however, it had been concluded that the presence of some gas was necessary in a valve. In that year Dr. Irving Langmuir, of the General Electric Company of America, as the result of research based on the earlier work of Dr. J. A> Fleming, Sir J. J. Thomson and Prof. O. W. Richardson, produced the first commercial tubes in which the action was demonstrably due to pure electron discharge from the filament, and not to the presence of minute traces of gas. One of these tubes, a diode, he named a ""Kenetron."" The other, an example of which is here shown, was called a ""Pliotron."" In this tube, which is intended for amplification of radio signals, the filament is of tungsten and the grid and anode are of nickel wire. The grid is wound with very fine wire supported on a glass framework, and the characteristic curve is such that the anode-grid slope conductance is about 0.275 ma. per grid volt. The general form of the curve is given by :- ia = A (Va + m Vg).312 where ia is the anode current, Va is the anode voltage, Vg the grid voltage and m a constant depending on the relative shapes and positions of the electrodes. By means of an original mercury condensation pump Dr. Langmuir succeeded in exhausting these tubes down to a pressure o fthe order of 1/100,000 mm. of mercury, at which pressure the characteristics of the valve are perfectly smooth and regular.

(a) A generator giving an acoustic signal of definite pitch.
(b) A coupling unit, by means of which the signal note heard in the amplifiers can be compared with the unamplified signal.
(c) An artificial earth circuit. A diagram of the apparatus is shown. The set was also used for comparing the low-frequency magnification of the ""R"" valve in these amplifiers, to the shaft of a Wilson motor, to the shaft of which is fitted an aluminium disc with 24 iron teeth. These teeth pass in front of the magnet of a telephone receiver, and the combination forms a small power alternator. The shaft of the motor is fitted with a speed indicator, so that the alternator can be run to give a definite note. On the same board is an electric bell magnet, the hammer of which makes and breaks a contact which short-circuits the telephone magnet coil, and so interrupts the alternator current periodically, thus producing a current consisting of a succession of dots. Across the contacts of the electric bell magnet circuit is a 4 mfd. condenser, which prevents the noise due to the spark from passing to the amplifier. Piece B.

The current from the alternator passes through the fixed coil; the movable coil being connected to the dummy earth (piece c) which is connected to the amplifier to be tested. The energy transferred to the amplifier can thus be varied by altering the coupling. To the fixed coil is coupled a small coil whose position cannot be varied. A change-over switch, which operates by pressing and releasing, enables one to connect the telephone to this fixed coil on pressing, and to the telephone terminals of the amplifier under test on releasing. The fixed coil yields a constant comparison signal. When the 'phones are connected to the amplifier they are shunted with a resistance of 70 ohms, which enables a louder signal to be amplified and so reduces the relative intensity of amplifier noises with the signal.

The transmitting group consists of a transmitter Mark III*, a 30-watt high-tension unit and 10-volt, 16-amp. accumulator. The receiving group consists of a Receiver Mark III and selector. (a) *Transmitting Group.*—The transmitter consists essentially of a valve oscillator having tuned anode and grid circuits, and normally drawing its high-tension supply from a high tension unit, the action of which is controlled by the operating key. The folding operating key, aerial ammeter and tuning lamp are mounted on a metal panel and remain accessible when the cover is closed. High-tension current is supplied from a 30-watt induction coil, which takes 2.3 amps. at 10 volts from an accumulator and supplies 15-20 milliamperes at about 1,000 volts to the transmitting valves. The primary current for the H.T. unit and the heating current for the valve filaments are supplied by the same 10-volt accumulator, 6 volts being tapped off through a resistance for the latter purpose. On pressing the key this resistance is short-circuited, and the full 6 volts are applied to the filaments. A moment later the front stop of the key makes contact and closes the primary circuit of the H.T. unit, causing the latter to operate and supply high-tension current to the valves. The valve grid is connected with an aperiodic grid leak, consisting of a condenser of 0.001 mfd., shunted by a resistance of 6,000 ohms. The tuning of the aerial circuit is effected by means of an inductance tapped off to a 10-point switch, and fine tuning between the steps of the inductance is carried out by means of a spherical variometer coil. For longer wave-lengths, a fixed condenser is connected in parallel with the aerial tuning inductance, and this may be brought into circuit or cut out. The coupling between the aerial and anode circuits is varied by means of a reaction coil. A short and flexible lead named the ""Anode Tap,"" the anodes can be connected with either the aerial end of the aerial-tuning inductance or some other point on this inductance. The change-over switch, which forms part of the transmitter, performs the following operations: in its ""send"" position it connects aerial and earth with the transmitting valve filament circuit, and disconnects the receiver from the low-tension battery; in its ""off"" position it connects the aerial, earth, and low-tension battery from the transmitter and receiver; in its ""receive"" position it connects aerial and earth with the receiver, closes the receiving valve filament circuit and opens the transmitting valve circuit.—In this instructional model the component parts of the continuous wave transmitter, Mark III, are mounted on a wooden baseboard. (c) The receiver is itself a valve oscillator and is so adjusted as to generate continuous oscillations of small amplitude, having a frequency slightly different to that of the incoming oscillations. As a result of this slight difference of frequency, ""beats"" of an audible frequency are produced. These pulses after being amplified by a second valve, arranged for low-frequency amplification, are applied to the head receivers and produce an audible signal. The 60-volt high-tension battery (not shown) fits within a cavity in the left-hand side of the case. The receiver may be used with or without a selector. If the selector is not in use, the aerial, earth and low-tension battery are connected with the receiver by means of the change-over switch. The current from the low-tension battery then flows through the two-valve filaments in parallel and is regulated by an adjustable series resistance. One end of the aerial and earth are connected with the aerial end of the inductance is connected through a fixed condenser, shunted by a resistance of 200,000 ohms, with the grid of the first valve, the other end being connected with the negative side of the high-tension battery is connected with the positive valve filaments, high-tension positive being connected through the reaction coil, with the outside winding of inter-valve transformer and the junction of a shunt condenser is connected between filament negative and the junction coil with the primary winding of the inter-valve transformer, in order to provide a path for oscillating currents. High-tension positive is also connected through the high-resistance winding of the telephone transformer with the plate of the second (amplifying) valve, the grid of this valve being connected to the secondary winding of the inter-valve transformer with filament negative. The telephone sockets are connected in parallel across the primary of the telephone transformer. (d) Heterodyne Wave-meter.—This wave-meter has a range of wave-lengths from 400 metres to 3,000 metres, and is itself a generator of continuous waves with an oscillating circuit consisting of a reaction coil, variable condenser, and a ""French"" type valve. The inductance and reaction coils are carried in coil boxes, one of which is used for wave lengths of 400 metres to 1,400 metres and the other for wave lengths of 1,200 metres to 3,000 metres. The variable condenser is calibrated with two scales to suit whichever coil is used. Tuning is carried out by means of a variometer. To tune the meter it is necessary to rotate the variable condenser until a silent point is reached, on either side of which ""beats"" at high frequency can be heard. The wave-meter may be used to tune the receiver or transmitter to a definite wave-length or to measure the wave-lengths of received or transmitted waves. (e) Selector and Rectifier.—The selector and rectifier units are optional attachments. They were used separately or in combination to obtain greater freedom from interference. The selector consists of a pair of coils with variable electro-magnetic rotary coupling between them. One of these can be connected across the primary of the inter-valve transformer, and the other has a variable condenser across it and forms part of the receiver circuit. The receiving portion of the set is thereby converted into a two-circuit instrument. The rectifier unit is for converting the alternating high-tension voltage obtained from the vibratory unit into approximately pure D.C. One or, alternatively, two triodes are used in parallel, their grids being connected together and to one terminal of the alternating high-tension supply. The heated filament is connected to one side of a reservoir condenser, the other side of which is connected to the other terminal of the high-tension supply.

This set was designed during the War of 1914–18 to meet the demand for apparatus with low transmitting power to minimise jamming, and was first manufactured in 1919. For this purpose a more sensitive receiver than usual was used, consisting of three stages of semi-tuned high-frequency amplification, a separate heterodyne, and a three-valve detector-amplifier. The set was troublesome to handle, chiefly owing to instability in the high-frequency stages, but ranges of ten miles with aerials 15 ft. high were obtained, and this at the time was satisfactory. With aerials 48 ft. high 100 miles was easily obtained. The set consists of a very simple transmitter of pure C.W., a highly selective tuner, and the amplifiers already described. The transmitter has an untuned grid circuit, and is fed either from a generator or from dry cells. Fine tuning between the studs of the A.T.I. switch is obtained by means of a variometer. The coils are wound with 9/40 stranded silk-covered wire. The tuner has two circuits with variable coupling between them. The coils all consist of three-layer step windings, and tuning is carried out by variable condensers connected across these windings. The tuner carries also a send receive switch.

Rated at 120 watts input, the range of these sets was about 200 miles with a safety factor of 2.
Although not wholly satisfactory, either as regards efficiency or reliability, they represented a distinct advance on previous sets, much ingenuity being shown in the detailed design of the several units as well as in the general lay out.
Power for operating the set was drawn from non-spillable accumulators of 90 ampere-hours capacity. These, together with the set and the aerial equipment, consisting of two 48-ft. masts in sections and a twin aerial of length 300 ft. were carried in a light motor van which also served as office accommodation when the station was erected.
The transmitting apparatus on the left consists of a rotary converter fed from the accumulators and delivering alternating current at 40 volts, 900 cycles. This passes through an auto-transformer with tappings (seen in front of the transmitter) to control the power.
The voltage is now stepped up to 1,400, and is either fed direct to the two transmitting valves (""Tonic Train"") or is first passed through the double-wave rectifier on the right of the transmitter, in which case approximately pure C.W. will be transmitted. The range of wave-lengths is from 600 metres to 2,500 metres.
The receiver (on the right) is of the two-circuit type, the secondary winding being provided with tappings which make it aperiodic when the switch is in the ""stand by"" position.

Turner for the unusually low wave-length of 50 metres. It consists of two units. One of these, the upper ""unit,"" contains the transmitting and receiving triodes and their appropriate oscillatory circuits, and when in use is situated close to the antenna. The ""lower unit"" contains the necessary control apparatus and can be placed anywhere within reasonable distance of these, being connected to the upper unit by a multicore rubber cable. The high-tension current for transmission is derived from the hand generator or from a battery of dry cells. The transmitter, which is of the choke-control type, has a fixed tuned anode circuit with an aperiodic grid coil. Coupled to these circuits, which are used for reception as well as for transmission, is the antenna circuit which is tuned by means of a semi-adjustable condenser. On account of the low wave-length, and of certain peculiarly troublesome interaction effects which were encountered, the designer found it necessary to insert a coupling condenser of one micro-microfarad capacity between the antenna and closed circuits. The amplifier-detector comprises three stages of transformer-coupled high-frequency amplification, a detector triode utilising simple anode rectification, and two stages of low-frequency amplification. The anode potentials of all six triodes, and the grid potentials of the second and third stages, are finely adjust-able by means of potentiometers. The standard antenna equipment con-sisted of a single 40-ft. wire suspended between two 4-ft. masts, and following the usual practice, the “ earth ” connection was made to a 4-ft. mat of copper gauze laid on the ground. With such a low antenna and so short a wave-length, the screening effect of obstacles was naturally serious, but the range between a pair of these stations was seldom less than two miles, while in the open country six miles was by no means unusual.",,,"[{'name': 'L.

174,,"Inv. 1923-605, S.M. 2162",Whole,N/A,BROADCASTING MICROPHONE,loaned,BROADCASTING MICROPHONE,"Made and lent by The Western Electric Company. This microphone is used for broadcasting, and in conjunction with special amplifiers and loud-speaking telephone apparatus to enable a speaker without raising his voice to address large public gatherings. By making use of trunk telephone lines, several such gatherings in different towns have been simul-taneously addressed by the same person.
In the case of the Public Address System developed by the Western Electric Company, the apparatus employed comprises a microphone—such as the one exhibited, to pick up the sound of the speaker's voice—a vacuum-tube amplifying arrangement, and one or more loud-speaking telephones to distribute the amplified speech-sounds. Each portion is designed so as to be as nearly distor-tionless as possible over the range of frequencies which constitute speech.
The microphone, is of a type known as the “ push-pull ” type, having two variable resistance elements, one on each side of the diaphragm. The latter is an air-damped steel disc, tensioned so as to have a natural frequency of about 8,000 periods per second. Owing to this high natural frequency and to the fact that it is damped, it responds uniformly to all the frequencies (200–4,000) which occur in normal speech. The two carbon buttons have each a resistance of 100 ohms and are connected in series, the electrical path being from the rear carbon electrode in each case through the carbon granules to a gold-plated area on the diaphragm itself. This double-button construction almost completely eliminates the distortion caused by the non-linear nature of the pressure-resistance characteristics of granular carbon. The microphone is suspended by springs to avoid vibration, and can pick up speech from a distance of five or six feet. On account of its special construction, however, its sensitivity is only about 1/1,000th that of the ordinary telephone transmitter, and this necessitates additional amplification. No horn is fitted to the microphone, as this would introduce resonance and consequent lack of uniformity of behaviour to all frequencies.
The complete system (of which the microphone is only a representative portion) has given remarkable results. On November 11th, 1921, speeches made at Arlington, Virginia, were heard by 100,000 persons there and simultaneously by 35,000 in New York and by 20,000 in San Francisco, telephone trunk lines being used in conjunction with the system.",,,"[{'name': 'The Western Electric Company', 'role': 'maker'}, {'name': 'The Western Electric Company', 'role': 'lent by'}]",[],,"['steel', 'carbon', 'gold-plated']","['8,000 periods per second', '200–4,000', '100 ohms', 'five or six feet', '1/1,000th']","['This microphone is used for broadcasting, and in conjunction with special amplifiers and loud-speaking telephone apparatus to enable a speaker without raising his voice to address large public gatherings.', 'By making use of trunk telephone lines, several such gatherings in different towns have been simul-taneously addressed by the same person.', ""In the case of the Public Address System developed by the Western Electric Company, the apparatus employed comprises a microphone—such as the one exhibited, to pick up the sound of the speaker's voice—a vacuum-tube amplifying arrangement, and one or more loud-speaking telephones to distribute the amplified speech-sounds."", 'Each portion is designed so as to be as nearly distor-tionless as possible over the range of frequencies which constitute speech.', 'The latter is an air-damped steel disc, tensioned so as to have a natural frequency of about 8,000 periods per second.', 'Owing to this high natural frequency and to the fact that it is damped, it responds uniformly to all the frequencies (200–4,000) which occur in normal speech.', 'This double-button construction almost completely eliminates the distortion caused by the non-linear nature of the pressure-resistance characteristics of granular carbon.', 'The microphone is suspended by springs to avoid vibration, and can pick up speech from a distance of five or six feet.', 'On account of its special construction, however, its sensitivity is only about 1/1,000th that of the ordinary telephone transmitter, and this necessitates additional amplification.', 'No horn is fitted to the microphone, as this would introduce resonance and consequent lack of uniformity of behaviour to all frequencies.', 'The complete system (of which the microphone is only a representative portion) has given remarkable results.', 'On November 11th, 1921, speeches made at Arlington, Virginia, were heard by 100,000 persons there and simultaneously by 35,000 in New York and by 20,000 in San Francisco, telephone trunk lines being used in conjunction with the system.']",[],1923,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 0, 'terms': []}"

182,EARLY COIL DIRECTION FINDER,1923-606,Whole,N/A,,loaned,EARLY COIL DIRECTION FINDER,"Made and lent by The National Physical Laboratory. 1916. This coil, which was designed in 1916, is believed to be the first direction finder to have been taken into the air. Experiments with it were successfully carried out on aircraft in 1917 and the method was immediately adopted by the Air Ministry. Similar experiments carried out on board ship proved equally successful and form the foundation of the development of the present day direction finder. The general principle of the method of determining the direction of an incoming wireless signal by means of a rotating closed coil may be briefly described as follows:— A flat rectangular coil is suspended with its plane vertical in such a manner that it is capable of rotating about a vertical axis. The coil is connected to a tuning condenser to form a closed oscillatory circuit, and leads from the condenser are taken to the usual form of detecting receiver. When the circuit is tuned to the frequency of the incoming electro-magnetic waves, an oscillatory current is induced of sufficient strength under favourable circumstances to give audible signals in the telephone receiver. The magnitude of this current is dependent upon the angle between the axis of the coil and the direction of the transmitting station. A simple consideration of the magnetic field associated with the incoming waves shows that when the axis of the coil points towards the transmitting station, the intensity of the received waves is a minimum. By rotating the coil, therefore, the minimum position, and hence the direction of the arriving waves can be determined. There is with the type of frame under consideration an ambiguity of 180°, since no indication is given as to whether the bearing of the transmitting station is (x) or (x + 180°), but this ambiguity is removed where direction-finding stations work in pairs on the ground.

The laminated armature nearly closes the V-shaped gap between the poles of the core, the air space being only about 0.25 mm.

It is mainly intended as a subsidiary means of communication when aerials are inadmissible or have been destroyed by barrage, and has a range from 2,000 yards to 5,000 yards according to the nature of the earth connections and sub-soil.
The set includes a buzzer for transmission and a three-valve amplifier C, Mark III, for reception. Earth pins are placed at either end of a base about six yards length and these are connected with two spring clip terminals on a six-line commutator. Three different bases may be connected with the com- mutator and the desired base connected to either the buzzer or amplifier by means of a change-over switch. The buzzer consists essentially of an induction coil, the armature of which vibrates at a definite frequency. Current is supplied to the primary winding from a 10-volt battery, and when the transmitting key is pressed, the armature vibrates and a high-tension vibrating current is sent to earth via the change-over switch and commutator. Three interchangeable armatures having different periods of vibration are provided. A condenser is connected across the break to reduce sparking.
The three-valve amplifier is carried together with its high-tension battery (not shown) in the left-hand compartment of the case. The signals received pass through the commutator and change-over switch (set to “receive”) and enter the primary of the “earth to valve transformer.” The secondary of this trans- former connects the grid of the first valve to the negative limb of the valve filament through a dry cell, so that the grid is kept at a small negative potential with respect to the filament. This permits only a small current to pass in the grid filament circuit and the valves work under conditions such that the current between grid and filament is small and constant for small changes in grid volts.

200,,1924-163,Whole,N/A,WIRED WIRELESS,loaned,WIRED WIRELESS SETS,"These sets were designed by Capt. H. P. T. Lefroy, R.E. The term ""wired wireless"" has been used to describe a system of multiplex electrical communication based on the use of one or more high-frequency carrier currents which are transmitted along wires or cables in the form of telegraph or telephone signals. Although some of the principles underlying such a system were already known it was not until 1910 that General G. O. Squier, of the United States Army, pointed out the practicable possibilities and described experiments made with high-frequency alternators. He also constructed portable buzzer-operated sets for field use, but, owing to the large attenuation constant inherent in the wave length used, 1,100 metres, the range of these sets was not great. Following on preliminary experiments in 1914, Capt. Lefroy, in 1915, designed for the British Army Signal Service a series of ""wired wireless"" sets working at four different frequencies which could be operated simultaneously on a normal telephone line, thus providing four extra channels of high-frequency communication. Two of these sets, which were used at the battle of Loos, are exhibited. They contain fundamental improvements, in that adjustments of the carrier frequency are effected independently of the line constants; while the frequencies are so chosen that a reduction in attenuation corresponding to a tenfold increase of range is obtained. A value of coupling was chosen to give the greatest strength of signals compatible with absence of interference from other sources. The later developments of carrier-current telegraphy and telephony for non-military use have been very rapid, chiefly owing to the use of triodes, and to progress in the design of filter circuits for separating the various high-frequency currents; thus, in April, 1923, there were in operation, between Pittsburgh and Chicago, 128 full duplex channels of communication, based on three carrier-current circuits. The four sets designed were given frequencies corresponding to wave lengths of 4,000, 8,000, 16,000 and 32,000 metres, and were known as A, B, C and D sets respectively, of which the B and C sets are shown. The range of the D set on a single open wire was 40 miles. From the diagram it will be seen that a closed oscillatory circuit, energised by a battery and vibrator, is inductively coupled to an acceptor circuit which is connected to the line and earth. This acceptor circuit is known as a ""tuned link,"" and it is important to notice that in operation it is permanently tuned to the same frequency as the closed circuit, regardless of the line constants. The same oscillatory circuits are used, both for transmission and reception, the necessary connections being made by means of contacts on the signalling key. The buzzer-modulated high-frequency currents are transmitted along the line instead of being radiated as in normal wireless signalling, and a very small battery is used to afford a reserve of power. The received currents are rectified by a crystal in the usual manner. The design of the inductance coils should be noted; they are of the now familiar “basket” formation originated by Capt. Lefroy in 1914; they were the first low-capacity coils to be designed and possess a high ratio of inductance per unit of volume.",,,"[{'name': 'Capt. H. P. T.

A wavemeter (not shown). (B). Photographic apparatus for photographing spark trains, generated in the main oscillatory circuit by means of a gap and by help of a rotating mirror. (A) The wavemeter consisted of a variable condenser (from 100 to 900 m.mfd.) of special design, having a direct-reading scale, reading 1 in 1000 at the lower end, and 1 in 200 at the upper, carefully tested, and found by Maxwell's Commutator Method to be uniform. Three inductance coils were used, wound on ebonite formers, of stranded 7/36 wire, and having terminals removed 18.5 cm. from the centre of the coils to avoid interference from the condenser plates. A Duddell thermo-ammeter of 1.5 ohms resistance completed the coil-condenser circuit, and the point of maximum resonance was obtained by observing the point of maximum deflection. The wavemeter was very loosely coupled with the oscillatory circuit of the testing apparatus. (B). A small alternator of variable frequency (50 to 200 periods per sec.) was connected through a small high voltage transformer to a spark gap, having cadmium electrodes, shunted by a glass plate condenser, and a bare wire inductance in oil. A large variable air condenser could be put in parallel with the glass plate condenser, and by varying the capacity and inductance in circuit, oscillations of frequencies from 300,000 to 1,200,000 periods per sec. could be obtained. The special camera, which forms the exhibit, is mounted on a long slab of sandstone for rigidity. A rotating mirror was fixed on a vertical axis at one end, and driven by a small motor, the speed of which was kept constant by means of a commutator mounted on the axis. This was connected with a bridge battery and galvanometer for measuring capacity; by applying a light variable brake to the axis, the galvanometer light spot could be kept at zero, when the speed remained steady (usually about 60 r.p.m.). The other end of the camera has two branches which carry respectively the spark electrodes and means for allowing the plate carrier to be smoothly raised and lowered, whilst the rotating mirror throws the image of the spark trains as streaks upon the plate.
