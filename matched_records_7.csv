uiug.30112069175039-seq_12.jpg,1,PROPOSED FLYING MACHINE. (Scale 1: 7.),"Presented by P. Y. Alexander, Esq., and C. H. M. A. Alderson, Esq.",1907. (Design patented 1842; Model built 1844-5.),"This model, the design for which was patented in 1842 by Mr. W. S. Henson, was built in 1844-5 by Messrs. Henson and J. Stringfellow. Henson's proposal to utilise the fixed surfaces of an aeroplane to obtain support from the air was regarded at the time as a possible solution of the problem of flight. Henson's idea was to imitate soaring birds, all previous attempts being based on vibrating or rotating surfaces, after the manner of flapping wings. It was intended that the actual machine should be used as a conveyer of letters, goods, and passengers. The model consists of an extended surface or aeroplane of oiled silk or canvas, stretched upon a bamboo frame made rigid by trussing, both above and below. A car is attached to the under side of the aeroplane to contain the steam engine, passengers, etc. It has three wheels to run freely upon when it reaches earth. Two propellers, 3 ft. diameter, are shown with their blades set at 45 degrees; they are operated by endless cords from the steam engine (see No. 40). Behind these is a fan-shaped tail, stretched upon a triangular frame capable of being opened out, closed, or moved up and down by means of cords and pulleys. By this latter arrangement ascent or descent was to be accomplished. A rudder for steering sideways is placed under the tail, and above the main aeroplane a sail (not shown) was to be stretched between two masts rising from the car, to assist in maintaining the course. When in motion the front edge of the machine was to be raised in order to obtain the required air support. To start the model it was proposed to allow it to run down an incline, e.g., the side of a hill, the propellers being first set in motion. The velocity gained in the descent was expected to sustain it in its further progress, the engine overcoming the head resistance when in full flight. Experiments were eventually made on the downs, near Chard, and the night trials were abandoned, as the silk became saturated from a deposit of dew. After many day trials, down wide, inclined rails, the model was found to be deficient in stable equilibrium for open-air experiments, little puffs of wind or ground currents being sufficient to destroy the balance. The actual machine was never constructed, but in 1847-48 J. Stringfellow built a model which is supposed to be the first flying machine which performed a successful flight. The dimensions of the model shown are 20 ft. from tip to tip of wings, by 3.5 ft. wide, giving 70 sq. ft. sustaining surface to the wings and about 10 sq. ft. in the tail. Its weight is about 25 lb. The actual machine was to weigh about 3,000 lb., with 4,500 sq. ft. surface in the wings and 1,500 in the tail. A lithograph of the proposed machine is shown.",Inv. 1907-29. S.M. 312.

Date of creation: 1908. (Model 1846-48.)
Object entry information: The model of which the wings, tail, engine and boiler are shown was constructed by Mr. J. Stringfellow in 1846, and was designed for indoor experiments. The sustaining planes were shaped like the wings of a bird, and were slightly curved on the under side. They were also feathered at the back edge, in order that the yielding of the feathers might automatically regulate the fore-and-aft stability. It is stated that during the experiments the model rose after leaving the sustaining wire as much as 1 in 7, and that a free flight of about 40 yds. was eventually made with the model. The sustaining surface was 17 sq. ft., and the planes measured 10 ft. over the tips. The motive power was supplied by a steam engine placed inside a car between and underneath the wings. It had a cylinder .75 in. diameter by 2 in. stroke. The boiler was of the water-tube type as used by Henson, Stringfellow, and others, and consisted of inverted truncated cones arranged around and above the furnace. The cones were connected with a central steam drum above them and with water chambers below. Two four-bladed propellers 16 in. diameter were employed. The propeller speed was increased in the ratio of 3 : 1 by bevel gear on the crank shaft.

The wings are held in position by a number of supporting wires above and below, attached to king-posts. The principal member of the framework is an approximately circular hoop of willow, across which pass in a fore-and-aft direction two willow rods that ultimately converge at a point where the bamboo tail rod emerges from the wing surface. Transversely across the hoop passes the main beam, and immediately behind this an opening is provided in the surface to accommodate the upper part of the pilot’s body. Two small bolsters attached to the frame rest under the pilot’s shoulders, and the pilot’s arms pass through rests provided for them in the corners of the x-shaped main beam. The tail portion of the machine is supported by a bamboo rod, and consists of a horizontal plane hinged separately to a vertical plane which is attached rigidly to the main frame. The control of the machine is effected by the movement of the pilot’s body to correct any deviation from the level position. The span of the machine is 22 ft.

The machine consists of a braced structure of steel tubes and wires connected to large inclined surfaces, called aeroplanes, that possess a total area of 5,400 sq. ft. and slope at an angle of 7·25 degrees with the horizontal. The extreme width of the machine is 120 ft. and the length 104 ft. It is propelled by two two-bladed screws, each 17·83 ft. diameter by 16 ft. pitch, driven by compound engines with cylinders 5 in. and 8 in. diameter by 12 in. stroke, making 375 revolutions per minute and exerting together 360 h.p. The thrust from the two propellers working in the air is 2,000 lb., and the lifting effort is derived from this by the action of the aeroplanes. Steam at 300 lb. pressure is supplied from a tubulous boiler of the Thornycroft type, fired by naphtha delivered under a pressure of 50 lb. as 7,650 spray jets through hollow firebars. The boiler has a heating surface of 800 sq. ft. and a grate area of 30 sq. ft.; its weight is 900 lb., and with feed heaters, burners and water 1,200 lb.

Object name: LILIENTHAL GLIDER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Royal Aeronautical Society.
Date of creation: 1920.
Object entry information: This machine is one of those used by Otto Lilienthal in his experiments on “gliding” near Berlin, in 1895 and 1896. Unfortunately, during one of these flights, in August, 1896, the machine then employed capsized and fell to the ground, Lilienthal being killed. The wings, which may be folded, are constructed of fabric mounted on willow ribs, the hinge centres of the wings being about 6 ft. apart. The wings are held in position by a number of supporting wires above and below, attached to king-posts. The principal member of the framework is an approximately circular hoop of willow, across which pass in a fore-and-aft direction two willow rods that ultimately converge at a point where the bamboo tail rod emerges from the wing surface. Transversely across the hoop passes the main beam, and immediately behind this an opening is provided in the surface to accommodate the upper part of the pilot’s body. Two small bolsters attached to the frame rest under the pilot’s shoulders, and the pilot’s arms pass through rests provided for them in the corners of the x-shaped main beam. The tail portion of the machine is supported by a bamboo rod, and consists of a horizontal plane hinged separately to a vertical plane which is attached rigidly to the main frame. The control of the machine is effected by the movement of the pilot’s body to correct any deviation from the level position. The span of the machine is 22 ft.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Royal Aero Club of Great Britain.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: The early investigations of Octave Chanute in America were on the subject of bird flight, and it was not until the year 1895 that he began the construction of a glider in collaboration with Herring, a pupil of Lilienthal. The Chanute glider was developed from a multiplane, with wing tips which swung back, when struck by wind gusts, into a simple and more efficient two-decker as shown, in which the tail was partly controlled by springs. The wings were single surfaced, with the ribs exposed. The pilot hung with his armpits supported by the padded rests on the framework of the machine, and controlled the balance by movements of his body.

A fore-and-aft motion operates the rear rudder, and a motion sideways operates the plane-warping mechanism of the machine. Side balance is maintained through the warping of the wings; moreover, it is stated that the vertical rudder is never used alone in changing the direction of the machine.
The motor, which was designed by Messrs. W. and O. Wright, is mounted on the lower main plane, and is of the four-cylinder vertical type, using petrol as fuel. It weighs about 200 lb., and develops about 24 brake h.p. at 1,200 revolutions per minute. It is water-cooled, the radiator consisting of flat vertical piping towed between the main planes. Two wooden propellers are employed, about 8.5 ft. diameter, and are mounted on parallel shafts 11.5 ft. apart. These propellers are driven in opposite directions at about 400 revolutions per minute, by chains direct from the motor shaft, one chain being crossed. For the greater part of their length these chains are protected by steel tubes packed with thick grease. The propeller shafts are slightly above the middle line between the main planes, in order to prevent any risk of the blades striking the ground. The aviator, pupil, and motor form a load symmetrically disposed about the centre line of the machine.
The starting apparatus consists of a derrick, and a wooden rail 75 ft. long with a flat bar of iron on the top. A starting beam, just long enough to reach from one runner of the aeroplane to the other, is attached at its centre by a swivel joint to a frame containing two ball-bearing wheels placed one in front of the other. These wheels are placed on the starting rail, small flanges keeping them in position. This arrangement allows the aeroplane to be easily turned on the starting rail. When about to start, the weight is drawn up to the top of the derrick, and the rope is attached to a release catch at the front of the machine. With its own motive power, and the impetus obtained from the falling weight, a high speed on the rail is produced. Immediately the aeroplane rises from the rail, the starting beam drops off.
The chief dimensions of the machine are: Length of each main plane, 40 ft.; width, 6.5 ft.; space between them, 6 ft.; total supporting surface, about 500 sq. ft.; front auxiliary planes, 16 ft. long; width, 2.5 ft.; total surface, about 75 sq. ft.; weight of machine, about 800 lb.; total weight with two persons and supplies, about 1,150 lb.

Maker/Donor: MM. Voisin Frères
Date of creation: 1908
Object entry information: This is a model of the aeroplane constructed in 1908 by MM. Voisin Frères, and was the pioneer of the Farman biplane.
This machine is a biplane, fitted with a front elevator and a box type of tail carried at the rear of the main planes upon a light outrigger framework. It was designed to be automatically and inherently stable, and is fitted with a steel tube chassis with four wheels mounted to swivel freely. The front wheels are provided with a spring suspension to diminish the shock of landing or that consequent on starting or alighting on rough ground. The nacelle, to which the chassis is attached, carries the engine, pilot, and passenger, while on the forward portion is mounted the front elevator. The main planes are single-surfaced, with fabric stretched over a framework of ash ribs lying across two transverse main spars, the front spar forming the leading edge. The tail, which is also of biplane form, is constructed similarly to the main planes, while the elevator differs in having a double surface. The elevator is actuated by means of a connecting rod attached to the steering wheel spindle. The rudder which resembles the elevator in form and construction is mounted on a vertical hinge pivoted on the rear spars of the tail planes, and is operated by wires which pass round a wooden drum on the steering spindle.
Another feature which characterises this machine is the presence of side curtains between the main planes and between the tail planes. Between the main planes there are four curtains, which consist of fabric stiffened by flat ribs enclosed in pockets.
The engine fitted is a 50 h.p. E.N.V., with the two-bladed steel propeller mounted on an extension of the crankshaft. The control is carried out entirely by the aid of the elevator and the rudder, the former being operated by pushing and pulling the steering wheel and the latter by turning the wheel upon its axis.
The principal data are: Span, 32 ft. 11 in.; chord, 6 ft. 9 in.; area of main planes, 445 sq. ft.; gap, 6 ft. 8 in.; length, 34 ft. 5 in.; engine, 50 h.p. E.N.V.

Object entry information: Plate IV. The first machine used by Henri Farman was made by Voisin Frères in 1907, and may be said to be the prototype of the highly successful Farman machine of to-day. The vertical panel surfaces or side curtains of the box-kite form of biplane associated with the name of Voisin have disappeared, and in consequence the modern Farman machine is considerably lighter in appearance.
The model, which has accommodation for two passengers in addition to the aviator, is of the military type, and represents the machine built in 1911 at Châlons-sur-Marne by Farman Frères for Mr. Graham-White. This machine was piloted by C. Hubert in the first aerial post from Hendon to Windsor. It differs principally from the earlier pattern in having removable extensions, each 5.5 ft. in length, on the ends of the upper main plane. Other characteristics of this type are its great weight-lifting capacity and size, and the addition of a central rudder in the tail. It is found to be very steady and safe, but somewhat slow, and is especially suited for military work.
The framework is of ash and consists essentially of a main truss, counter- braced throughout, the tension members being of wire. The upper main plane is superposed directly over the lower and the upper plane extensions are stayed to the ends of the lower plane by steel tubes. Above the extension pieces at the points where the steel tubes join them, are small inverted V's of sheet steel, over which run stay wires from the extreme tips of the wings to the outside pair of struts between the planes. In most Farman machines the upper surfaces of the main planes only are covered with fabric, the ribs of the frame being covered by pockets of fabric on the under side. The model, however, shows a machine in which both surfaces of each plane are completely covered.
Two elevating rudders are used, the front one being hinged to two sets of out- riggers firmly attached to the main frame. The rear rudder, which forms part of the top surface, of the tail is moved jointly with the front one, both being operated by a fore-and-aft movement of the lever in the aviator's right hand. The three steering rudders are situated at the sides and centre of the tail, and are operated by wires connected with a foot lever hinged at its centre. The two side rudders are hinged to the rear uprights of the tail, whilst the central one is similarly supported. The fixed portion of the biplane tail acts as a keel, and is said to steady the machine longitudinally, although the lifting power of the surface is small. Lateral stability is controlled by four ailerons, or hinged flaps, constituting the rear ends of the upper main plane. The flaps are operated by an athwartship movement of the lever in the aviator's right hand. When the machine is at rest the flaps hang loosely, but when in flight they fly out and the connecting wires become taut.
The starting and alighting gear consists of two long skids forming part of the framework, upon each of which is mounted a pair of elastic-sprung wheels. A single central skid supports the tail.
Power is supplied by a seven-cylinder, air-cooled, “Gnome” petrol motor, mounted on a shaft in the rear of the lower plane, and situated behind the pro- peller. The cylinders, which are of 110 mm. (4.33 in.) diameter by 120 mm. (4.72 in.) stroke, are of chrome-nickel-steel, and are machined, with their ribs, out of the solid. The seven connecting rods operate on a single crank-pin on the stationary crank shaft. The inlet valves are automatic, and are situated in the piston heads, whilst the exhaust valves are operated by rocking levers, and are situated in the centres of the cylinder heads. Lubrication is accomplished by a two-cylinder reciprocating pump. With this type of engine no fly-wheel is neces- sary. The engine develops 50 h.p. at 1,200 revolutions per minute. Two petrol tanks and an oil tank, situated behind the passengers' seats between the planes, are supported on a tubular framework. The propeller is of wood, of the Chauvière laminated type, and is 8.5 ft. diameter.
Total length of machine, 38 ft.; span (upper surface with extensions), 54 ft.; lower surface, 33.4 ft.; main supporting surface, with extensions, about 575 sq. ft.

Object name: FARMAN BIPLANE. (Scale 1: 10.)
Maker/Donor: Messrs. T. W. K. Clarke & Co.
Date of creation: 1911
Object entry information: Plate IV. The first machine used by Henri Farman was made by Voisin Frères in 1907, and may be said to be the prototype of the highly successful Farman machine of to-day. The vertical panel surfaces or side curtains of the box-kite form of biplane associated with the name of Voisin have disappeared, and in consequence the modern Farman machine is considerably lighter in appearance.
The model, which has accommodation for two passengers in addition to the aviator, is of the military type, and represents the machine built in 1911 at Châlons-sur-Marne by Farman Frères for Mr. Graham-White. This machine was piloted by C. Hubert in the first aerial post from Hendon to Windsor. It differs principally from the earlier pattern in having removable extensions, each 5.5 ft. in length, on the ends of the upper main plane. Other characteristics of this type are its great weight-lifting capacity and size, and the addition of a central rudder in the tail. It is found to be very steady and safe, but somewhat slow, and is especially suited for military work.
The framework is of ash and consists essentially of a main truss, counter- braced throughout, the tension members being of wire. The upper main plane is superposed directly over the lower and the upper plane extensions are stayed to the ends of the lower plane by steel tubes. Above the extension pieces at the points where the steel tubes join them, are small inverted V's of sheet steel, over which run stay wires from the extreme tips of the wings to the outside pair of struts between the planes. In most Farman machines the upper surfaces of the main planes only are covered with fabric, the ribs of the frame being covered by pockets of fabric on the under side. The model, however, shows a machine in which both surfaces of each plane are completely covered.
Two elevating rudders are used, the front one being hinged to two sets of out- riggers firmly attached to the main frame. The rear rudder, which forms part of the top surface, of the tail is moved jointly with the front one, both being operated by a fore-and-aft movement of the lever in the aviator's right hand. The three steering rudders are situated at the sides and centre of the tail, and are operated by wires connected with a foot lever hinged at its centre. The two side rudders are hinged to the rear uprights of the tail, whilst the central one is similarly supported. The fixed portion of the biplane tail acts as a keel, and is said to steady the machine longitudinally, although the lifting power of the surface is small. Lateral stability is controlled by four ailerons, or hinged flaps, constituting the rear ends of the upper main plane. The flaps are operated by an athwartship movement of the lever in the aviator's right hand. When the machine is at rest the flaps hang loosely, but when in flight they fly out and the connecting wires become taut.
The starting and alighting gear consists of two long skids forming part of the framework, upon each of which is mounted a pair of elastic-sprung wheels. A single central skid supports the tail.
Power is supplied by a seven-cylinder, air-cooled, “Gnome” petrol motor, mounted on a shaft in the rear of the lower plane, and situated behind the pro- peller. The cylinders, which are of 110 mm. (4.33 in.) diameter by 120 mm. (4.72 in.) stroke, are of chrome-nickel-steel, and are machined, with their ribs, out of the solid. The seven connecting rods operate on a single crank-pin on the stationary crank shaft. The inlet valves are automatic, and are situated in the piston heads, whilst the exhaust valves are operated by rocking levers, and are situated in the centres of the cylinder heads. Lubrication is accomplished by a two-cylinder reciprocating pump. With this type of engine no fly-wheel is neces- sary. The engine develops 50 h.p. at 1,200 revolutions per minute. Two petrol tanks and an oil tank, situated behind the passengers' seats between the planes, are supported on a tubular framework. The propeller is of wood, of the Chauvière laminated type, and is 8.5 ft. diameter.
Total length of machine, 38 ft.; span (upper surface with extensions), 54 ft.; lower surface, 33.4 ft.; main supporting surface, with extensions, about 575 sq. ft.

Object entry information: and the crossing of the English Channel from Calais to Dover on July 25th, 1909. The model shown represents the machine known as No. XI, with which the Channel crossing was made. It is of the single passenger type, and, with the exception of the monoplane of M. Santos-Dumont (see No. 11), is the smallest which has met with any success.
The main frame or chassis of the machine is of rectangular section, and consists of four main members of poplar or ash supported at intervals by vertical struts; the whole is trussed by diagonal wires, all of which have strainers. In plan the frame tapers to an edge at the rear, and there is a slight taper from front to rear when viewed sideways.
The main wings, which are removable, are attached to the sides of the frame at the forward end. The framework of each wing consists of two stout wooden spars placed athwartships, crossed by a large number of curved ribs, the construction of which can be seen in the model. The front edges of the wings are rigidly stayed to the chassis by flat steel tapes. The wings are double-surfaced, and have a camber of about 3·5 in. in a fore-and-aft direction, while their extremities are rounded off. In order that the wings shall be easily removable, the inner ends of the spars extend some inches beyond the wings and are bolted into sockets fixed to the chassis. The auxiliary vertical steadying plane, which was originally placed above the wings, has been dispensed with. The steel frame of this auxiliary plane is, however, retained, and to it are fastened the stays which support the main wings from the upper side.
The auxiliary surfaces consist of a tail having separate tips pivoted about a horizontal axis, and a vertical rudder. The tail is built up in a similar manner to the wings, but its main transverse member is a steel tube which is carried by the lower members of the main frame, and is supported in bearings formed by aluminium clips. The tips can be inclined at will by the aviator, but the central portion of the tail remains fixed in the position in which it was placed at starting. Its angle of incidence can be adjusted before leaving the ground by means of a drilled metal quadrant and a bolt. The vertical rudder is controlled by a pedal in front of the seat, whilst the tips of the tail are operated by a vertical lever terminating in an inverted cup-shaped fitting—a method of control patented by Blériot in 1908. The cup is free to rock about its centre, and wires may be attached to points on its circumference. Any two such wires diametrically opposite to one another will form one control. The warping of the wings is effected by this means, as is also the control of the tail.
The starting and alighting arrangement consists of a pair of bicycle wheels at the front of the machine and a single wheel at the rear. The wheel forks are provided with springs, and also with leather straps, which act as stops. In passing over uneven ground the wheels rise and fall, and can also incline sideways, but have springs in their connections tending to restore them to their normal positions.
The Channel flight was accomplished with a three-cylinder Anzani motor of the semi-radial air-cooled type, developing 24 h.p. It had a bore of 100 mm. (3·94 in.) and a stroke of 150 mm. (5·9 in.).

Santos-Dumont rose from the ground in the record time of 6·2 secs., and attained the high speed of 60 miles per hour in free flight.
The introduction of bamboo as the material for the main framework, the wings and the tail, and the system of staying adopted, have conduced to make this type of machine exceedingly light and simple in construction. The main frame is a girder of triangular section formed of three bamboos, about 2 in. diam. at the larger ends, connected by steel struts of oval section.
When stationary the machine rests on two bicycle wheels at the front end and a skid near the rear; these wheels are inclined in order to minimise the stresses should the machine land sideways. At the forward end of the chassis are the main planes or wings, the two chief supporting members of which are transverse spars of ash, which taper slightly in depth, becoming thinner where they join the central bamboo. Firm connections are made between the central bamboo and these spars by fitting them into rectangular sockets brazed to bosses on the framework. The

The machine then built, named the “Etrich Wels III,” was very similar to the modern Etrich monoplane, so successful in Austria, excepting that it had a front elevating plane that has since been removed. Both in Austria and in Germany this type of monoplane is greatly relied upon for military purposes, and many fine flights stand to its credit in both countries. With a Rumpler monoplane Hirth won the first German reliability competition, and in 1911 flew from Munich to Berlin with the same type of machine. The entire construction is on similar lines to those adopted by Lilienthal in his glider, and, on account of the general resemblance of the machine to a bird it was often called “Taube” or “pigeon.” The main frame of the machine consists of a central fuselage built of wood and entirely enclosed. It is of trapezoidal section at the front, where it affords accommodation for seats for the pilot and passenger tandem fashion. At the rear of the frame the transverse section changes into a triangular one. The supporting planes are shaped like a bird's wings, and the entire rear edge is flexible. The trailing edges of each plane or wings are curved upward at the tips, and this construction is stated to give great automatic stability. The two wings are set at a small dihedral angle. The main bracing of the wings consists of a single girder built of wood, placed laterally under the planes. The latter are braced by a large number of stay wires, both above and below, and the method followed is similar to that adopted by Lilienthal. The tail of the machine, which resembles that of a bird, extends from the after end of the fuselage, and consists of a horizontal and two vertical surfaces. The control for the horizontal portion of the tail, i.e. the elevator, is by means of a column or vertical lever pivoted at its base to move backward and forward. A forward push away from the pilot turns the tail down and elevates the machine. The rudder consists of two triangular surfaces, one above and one below the elevator, and is operated by pedals. Warping of the wings is accomplished by wire and pulley connections to a steering wheel mounted on the control column. The landing chassis is of the Blériot type, and consists of two bicycle wheels at the front of the machine, together with a rear skid. The wheels, except in the military type, can be steered while the machine is running over the ground. Power is supplied by a four-cylinder, water-cooled motor of 70 h.p., built in the front of the fuselage, the radiators being on each side of the latter.

One of the chief features of the machine shown is the divided front elevator, the two portions of which are capable of being warped in unison with the warping control of the main planes, as well as of being employed as an ordinary single elevator. The elevators are carried at their ends by long bamboo outriggers fastened to the ends of the struts between the main planes, and at the centre by outriggers carried to the landing chassis, and to the centre of the upper plane. There is no rear elevator. The tail, which is supported by long outriggers, consists of twin rudders, together with a pair of small fixed horizontal planes that serve as damper planes and help to preserve the longitudinal stability of the machine.

One of the chief features of the machine shown is the divided front elevator, the two portions of which are capable of being warped in unison with the warping control of the main planes, as well as of being employed as an ordinary single elevator. The elevators are carried at their ends by long bamboo outriggers fastened to the ends of the struts between the main planes, and at the centre by outriggers carried to the landing chassis, and to the centre of the upper plane. There is no rear elevator. The tail, which is supported by long outriggers, consists of twin rudders, together with a pair of small fixed horizontal planes that serve as damper planes and help to preserve the longitudinal stability of the machine. Control is effected by means of a universally-pivoted rod with a hand-wheel top, the feet being entirely free. This rod is free to move either laterally or fore-andaft, as well as to rotate on its axis. The last-named movement is used to control the rudders; the fore-and-aft movement of the lever controls the elevators acting as one, whilst the lateral motion operates the warping mechanism, the rudders and the differential movement of the elevators. The steering wheel is used for separate rudder control when turning. Immediately behind the pilot's seat is a passenger seat, whilst two other passenger seats were sometimes placed behind the pilot, but outside the "" nacelle."" The landing chassis is of heavy construction, and consists of a long stout central skid carrying a small pair of wheels in front, together with a larger pair situated in front of and under the main planes. These wheels are mounted on vertical telescopic tubes with spring shock absorbers; the wheel track is 3.5 ft. gauge. Small wheels are fitted as fenders to the wing tips. In the construction of the machine silver spruce was used for the spars and struts, hickory for the landing chassis, and bamboo bound with tape for the outriggers. The motor, which was of the six-cylinder Austrian Daimler type of 120 h.p., was carried on bearers placed on a platform supported from the chassis by diagonal struts. It drove a propeller, of Mr. Cody's design, 10.5 ft. diameter, at a comparatively low speed through a twin roller chain reduction gear. The chief particulars of the machine are: Span, 43 ft.; length, 34.3 ft.; chord, 5.5 ft.; gap, 6.5 ft.; main supporting surface, 430 sq. ft.; total supporting surface, 500 sq. ft.; total weight in flying order, 2,680 lb.; weight, empty, about 1,900 lb.",Inv. 1913-136.,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object name: WRIGHT BIPLANE. (Scale, 1: 10.)
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. Philipp Spandow, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1913
Object entry information: The model represents the Wright passenger biplane of 1911, which resembles closely the “Baby” Wright machine of 1910, designed especially for high speed. The machine differs in several essential points from the original Wright design, and a most noticeable departure consists in placing the monoplane elevator at the rear of the machine, where it forms part of the tail. The double elevator which was formerly at the front of the machine disappears entirely, and there are merely a pair of small surfaces, situated above and on the skids, fulfilling the same purpose as the half-moon shaped planes fitted between the front elevating planes in the earlier design. These surfaces tend to make the machine sensitive to movements of the rudder. The second important departure from the standard practice is the control, known as the Orville Wright control. The left-hand lever operates the simple elevator as previously, but it is fitted with a friction brake which automatically locks the lever in any desired position. The movements of the right-hand lever differ in their result entirely from those of the corresponding lever of the earlier design. A fore-and-aft movement of the lever warps the wing tips, and also moves the rudder, both these movements being obtained simultaneously. In addition to these movements the handle of the lever is hinged, and can be moved sideways by a wrist movement independently of the lever itself. The handle is connected by means of a bell-crank lever and rod with a free quadrant on the operating rock-shaft, the quadrant being connected with the rudder. Another similar quadrant on the operating rock-shaft connected with the wing tips is rigidly attached to the lever itself, and when the lever is moved to and fro both quadrants rotate, the free disc then becoming locked to the lever by a stiff spring. The engine fitted is of the N.A.G. (Neue Automobile Gesellschaft) type, having four cylinders mounted on an aluminium crank-case. It is capable of developing 55 h.p. at 1,603 revolutions per minute. On the continent this type of engine was much used, especially for military aeroplanes. A complete description of the original type of Wright biplane with the Wilbur Wright control is shown with the model of the machine (see No. 7). The chief dimensions of the machine are: Length of each main plane, 39 ft.; chord, 6·25 ft.; space between planes, 6 ft.; over-all length, 27·5 ft.

Object entry information: This type of aeroplane which has been adopted as the standard training machine by the Royal Air Force, was originally designed in 1913 for an 80 h.p. Gnome engine, and was used successfully during the war. It remains unaltered in all its essential aerodynamic features and main dimensions, but has been slightly modified and fitted with a more powerful engine. The machine was made by Messrs. A. V. Roe & Co., Ltd., Manchester. This two-seater biplane is fitted with a fuselage of rectangular section, built up of ash longerons, which are channelled out between the strut attachments and strengthened by flanges of three-ply wood. At the rear, the fuselage terminates in a vertical knife edge carrying a sternpost to which is hinged a balanced rudder, which is of the usual Avro type, as are also the tail plane and elevators. A stout ash tail skid is also fitted to prevent damage by the ground. The front portion of the fuselage carries the engine, which is enclosed by a metal cowl, and the pilot and passenger's cockpits. The rotary type engine is supported in two steel plate bearers, mounted in the nose of the fuselage, while an inspection door provided on each side of the cowling permits of a general examination of the engine and its accessories. Immediately behind the engine the petrol and oil tanks are mounted, while there is also a small gravity tank fitted in the centre section of the main planes. This centre section, which is horizontal, is supported by two pairs of ash struts.

Object name: FARMAN MILITARY BIPLANE. (Scale 1 : 12.)
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. T. W. K. Clarke & Co.
Date of creation: 1914
Object entry information: This model represents the military biplane of the 1913 type, designed by M. Henri Farman. It should be compared with the Farman biplane of 1911 (see No. 9), from which it was evolved. The brothers Maurice and Henri Farman combined in 1912 to manufacture aeroplanes in large quantities; they established a headquarters at Billancourt (Seine). The 1913 Henri Farman showed many improvements in design, the result of innumerable flights and experiments conducted with the object of producing a machine of greater speed and capable of quick manœuvre. An aluminium nacelle was fitted in the centre section of this machine. It contained seats for the pilot and observer; the latter occupied the rear seat, which was on a slightly higher level. The longerons, rudder post, and under-carriage were made of steel tubing, a departure from previous Farman practice. The forward elevator was abolished, a single rear plane and elevator being employed with a single rudder in place of that in duplicate on the earlier model. The modern type of spring tail skid was also fitted. A 70–80 h.p. Gnome engine was used with this as with the earlier machine. The principal data are: Length, 26.25 ft.; span of the top plane, 42.75 ft.; area, 376 sq. ft.; total weight, 793 lb.; useful weight, 661 lb.; maximum speed, about 65 miles per hour; endurance, 3 hours.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Disposal Board, Ministry of Munitions.
Date of creation: 1920
Object entry information: This type of aeroplane which has been adopted as the standard training machine by the Royal Air Force, was originally designed in 1913 for an 80 h.p. Gnome engine, and was used successfully during the war. It remains unaltered in all its essential aerodynamic features and main dimensions, but has been slightly modified and fitted with a more powerful engine. The machine was made by Messrs. A. V. Roe & Co., Ltd., Manchester. This two-seater biplane is fitted with a fuselage of rectangular section, built up of ash longerons, which are channelled out between the strut attachments and strengthened by flanges of three-ply wood. At the rear, the fuselage terminates in a vertical knife edge carrying a sternpost to which is hinged a balanced rudder, which is of the usual Avro type, as are also the tail plane and elevators. A stout ash tail skid is also fitted to prevent damage by the ground. The front portion of the fuselage carries the engine, which is enclosed by a metal cowl, and the pilot and passenger's cockpits. The rotary type engine is supported in two steel plate bearers, mounted in the nose of the fuselage, while an inspection door provided on each side of the cowling permits of a general examination of the engine and its accessories. Immediately behind the engine the petrol and oil tanks are mounted, while there is also a small gravity tank fitted in the centre section of the main planes. This centre section, which is horizontal, is supported by two pairs of ash struts.

Object entry information: This is the front portion of the Birdling monoplane used by Colonel McClean. It shows the Gnome engine seating together with a portion of the landing chassis. The engine fitted to this machine was a 50 h.p. Gnome, mounted between a pair of pressed-steel frames fastened to the front of the fuselage. When the machine was in use the engine mounting was covered above and at the sides by a sheet aluminium casing to prevent the splashing of the castor oil used as a lubricant. The oil and petrol tanks were placed behind the engine frame inside the body. The landing chassis differed from that used on the cross-channel Blériot machine (see No. 10) in that a rear skid was employed. The Gnome engine used on this machine is shown in an adjacent case.

Object entry information: (Scale approximately 1:17.) This model represents the small tractor biplane built by the Sopwith Aviation Co., towards the end of 1913. It was designed with the object of attaining very high speed together with capability of quick manœuvre. In 1914 this machine was utilised for military purposes, as, on account of its speed (92 miles per hour), it was specially suitable for scouting. The machine was of typical Sopwith design, being the forerunner of many models produced by this firm during the war (1914–18). The original biplane was fitted with an 80 h.p. Gnome engine. The top planes are secured to a centre panel supported above the fuselage by two pairs of struts; there are two other pairs of struts which separate the main planes near their extremities. The bottom planes are attached to the lower portion of the fuselage, which is of the usual Sopwith design. There is a slight dihedral angle, and the main planes are staggered to the extent of 1 foot. The principal data are: Span, 25 ft. 6 in.; over-all length, 20 ft.; gap, 4 ft. 3 in.; total area of main planes, 240 sq. ft.; area of elevators, 12 sq. ft.; loading, 3 lb. per sq. ft., or fully loaded, 4.5 lb.; weight, empty, 670 lb.; weight, with pilot and fuel for 3.5 hours, 1,060 lb. This machine should be compared with the “ 1½ Strutter ” (see No. 22) and the “ Salamander ” (see No. 24).

When used for transport purposes it is capable of accommodating 45 passengers, in addition to a crew of three, and 10,000 lb. of goods, with fuel for 400 to 500 miles. The Handley Page biplane, type V/1500, was a development of the twin-engined bomber of 1916. It was designed to operate over long distances, the fuel capacity being for a 14 hours’ flight. The upper and lower planes of this machine are of equal span, but the latter has a slight dihedral. There is a decided sweep-back on both planes. The fuselage has a passage running along its whole length. A gunner’s cockpit is provided behind the tail plane, the armament so placed protecting the machine from a rear attack. A gun is also fitted in the front of the fuselage. The undercarriage consists of two pairs of Vees, arranged one under each pair of power units.

Vickers, Ltd., London, S.W.",1919.,"This aeroplane, which was built at Weybridge, is the original machine on which the first direct trans-Atlantic flight was made by Captain Sir John Alcock, K.B.E., D.S.C., and Lieutenant Sir Arthur Whitten Brown, K.B.E., on the 14th–15th June, 1919, flying over a distance of 1,890 miles (3,041 kilometres) in 15 hours 57 minutes at an average speed of 118·5 miles, or 190·7 kilometres, per hour. This twin-engined biplane, which is inherently stable, was originally designed as a heavy bomber, and was slightly modified to enable it to accommodate sufficient fuel for the trans-Atlantic flight. The centre section of the main planes, which is horizontal, carries the two engines, each of which is enclosed, with its radiator and an oil tank, in a casing of approximately stream-line form, and supported between the wings by four vertical circular steel struts with wooden fairings. A service petrol tank is fitted in the centre section of the upper plane. The main planes on each side of the centre section have a dihedral angle of 3 degrees, and are set to an angle of incidence of 3½ degrees. The spars, which are of box section, are built up of spruce and three-ply and bound with fabric, while the interplane struts, with the exception of those carrying the engines, are of solid spruce. The upper and lower wings are of equal span and carry balanced ailerons. The fuselage is constructed in two parts, the forward portion ahead of the main plane rear spars being of steel tube, while the longerons of the rear portion are of McGruer’s patent wooden tube, and are braced with swaged steel tie-rods.

When used for transport purposes it is capable of accommodating 45 passengers, in addition to a crew of three, and 10,000 lb. of goods, with fuel for 400 to 500 miles. The Handley Page biplane, type V/1500, was a development of the twin-engined bomber of 1916. It was designed to operate over long distances, the fuel capacity being for a 14 hours’ flight. The upper and lower planes of this machine are of equal span, but the latter has a slight dihedral. There is a decided sweep-back on both planes. The fuselage has a passage running along its whole length. A gunner’s cockpit is provided behind the tail plane, the armament so placed protecting the machine from a rear attack. A gun is also fitted in the front of the fuselage. The undercarriage consists of two pairs of Vees, arranged one under each pair of power units. The front legs of the Vees carry shock absorbers enclosed in a stream-line fairing, the rear members being hinged. Four Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, of 375 h.p. each, are usually fitted. Alternatively, four B.H.P. Atlantic engines of 500 h.p. each or four Napier Lion engines may be used. The two forward units drive tractor airscrews of 13 ft. 5 in. diameter, while the rear units drive propellers with a diameter of 10 ft. 4 in. The principal data are: Span, 126 ft.; maximum gap, 15 ft; minimum, 12 ft.; chord, 12 ft.; total surface of main planes, 3,000 sq. ft.; weight, empty, 15,000 lb.; weight per h.p., 21 lb.; loading, 10 lb. per sq. ft.; tank capacity, 14 hours; speed low down, 103 miles per hour; speed at 10,000 ft., 95 miles per hour; landing speed, 50 miles per hour.

Object entry information: This aeroplane, which was built at Weybridge, is the original machine on which the first direct trans-Atlantic flight was made by Captain Sir John Alcock, K.B.E., D.S.C., and Lieutenant Sir Arthur Whitten Brown, K.B.E., on the 14th–15th June, 1919, flying over a distance of 1,890 miles (3,041 kilometres) in 15 hours 57 minutes at an average speed of 118·5 miles, or 190·7 kilometres, per hour. This twin-engined biplane, which is inherently stable, was originally designed as a heavy bomber, and was slightly modified to enable it to accommodate sufficient fuel for the trans-Atlantic flight. The centre section of the main planes, which is horizontal, carries the two engines, each of which is enclosed, with its radiator and an oil tank, in a casing of approximately stream-line form, and supported between the wings by four vertical circular steel struts with wooden fairings. A service petrol tank is fitted in the centre section of the upper plane. The main planes on each side of the centre section have a dihedral angle of 3 degrees, and are set to an angle of incidence of 3½ degrees. The spars, which are of box section, are built up of spruce and three-ply and bound with fabric, while the interplane struts, with the exception of those carrying the engines, are of solid spruce. The upper and lower wings are of equal span and carry balanced ailerons. The fuselage is constructed in two parts, the forward portion ahead of the main plane rear spars being of steel tube, while the longerons of the rear portion are of McGruer’s patent wooden tube, and are braced with swaged steel tie-rods. The two seats are arranged side by side, immediately behind a large petrol tank, in the nose of the machine. The tail, which is fitted with two balanced rudders and two fins, is of biplane form, each plane being set at an angle of 2½ degrees with the axis of the fuselage, and fitted with an elevator in the rear.

The maximum camber was 4 in. at a distance of about 2.5 ft. from the front edge. *Wright-Clarke Glider.*—The construction of the framework is generally similar to that of the Wright biplane. The spars are of spruce and the front spar is rounded off to form a blunt cutting edge. The maximum camber is 3 in. *Clarke Surface.*—This construction was designed by Mr. T. W. K. Clarke. The main transverse spars are of channel section, built of ash. The spacing of the ribs is 9 in., and the maximum camber is 3 in. at a distance of one-third the chord from the front edge.

Object entry information: Modern airscrews are built up of from four to eight separate laminations of walnut or mahogany, which are glued together stepwise. When set, the whole is pegged, and the sections at various points are worked out in accordance with the drawings, the remainder of the material being shaped in smooth curves to correspond. The four-bladed tractor airscrew shown, illustrates this process. The B.E. 2 type tractor airscrew represented is constructed of five laminæ of walnut glued together. One blade is shown in this, the first stage of manufacture. The second blade shows the glued-up block pegged and cut away, being shaped into curves to agree with the sections at various points previously determined from drawings. The third blade illustrates the stage prior to varnishing. The shaping to final section was accomplished by hand, special attention being paid to the leading and trailing edges. The pitch angle and blade section was checked, and the whole sand-papered and covered with a wood-filler. The fourth blade shows the airscrew in its finished state. The wood has been given two or three successive coats of copal varnish, being rubbed down after each coat with powdered pumice and a final coat of varnish applied.

Date of creation: 1920
Object entry information: This propeller has been fitted with a sheathing of naval brass in order to render it, to some extent, proof against machine-gun fire and other projectiles. The metal covering is designed to deflect projectiles, and to prevent thereby any penetration and consequent damage to the propeller. The metal sheathing has been set flush with the blade and riveted at regular intervals over its whole area. The rivets have been applied alternately from face and back, headed and filed to form a smooth surface. The whole sheathing was subsequently machined in order to give it the correct shape.

Date of creation: 1920
Object entry information: This is a portion of the Blériot monoplane which first crossed the Irish Channel from Holyhead to Dublin on 26th April, 1912. The control is of the type patented by M. Blériot in 1908. The mechanism consists of a hand lever universally jointed to a bracket, which is supported by a platform on the fuselage. At the lower end of the lever is a bell-shaped fitting, called the “cloche,” to the edge of which four wires are attached at equal intervals. The fore-and-aft wires operate the rear elevator, whilst those at the side operate the wing warping. The latter control wires do not lead directly to the wing tips from the cloche, but are taken to a rocking lever, supported at the apex of an inverted triangular mast attached to the underside of the fuselage. This rocking lever actuates a drum, round which the wires to the wing tips are wound in opposite directions. The vertical hand lever also carries the ignition advance lever and a throttle lever. A pedal operates the rudder (see model of Blériot monoplane. No. 10).

Object name: ENGINE FOR HENSON-STRINGFELLOW FLYING MACHINE MODEL.
Maker/Donor: Presented by C. H. M. A. Alderson, Esq.
Date of creation: 1907.
Object entry information: This steam engine was constructed to provide power for propelling the model shown suspended from the ceiling (see No. 1). It was placed inside the car, at the after end, in a vertical position, and was connected with the propeller on the flying machine by endless cords running over the wooden pulleys shown. The engine is direct-acting, and has a single cylinder 1·5 in. diameter, by 3 in. stroke. On the crank-shaft is fixed the grooved pulley for driving the propellers. The framework consists of an angle-iron structure containing the bearings for the crank-shaft and supporting the cylinder. The boiler consisted of 50 inverted truncated cones arranged around and above the furnace, and connected with a steam drum; they presented 100 sq. ft. of heating surface. The air-cooled tubular condenser gave a vacuum of from 5 to 8 lb. The speed of this model engine was to be 300 revolutions per minute, and the actual engine was intended to develop 25 to 30 h.p.

Object name: AEROPLANE ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Green Engine Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: The example shown is a four-cycle vertical cylinder engine, embodying the patents taken out by Mr. G. Green and others in 1904–5, and is especially designed for use on flying machines. This engine was entered for the Alexander Motor Prize Competition, 1911, and was awarded the prize of £1,000 offered by Mr. P. Y. Alexander. It has four cylinders, 140 mm. (5·5 in.) diameter by 146 mm. (5·85 in.) stroke, which, with their valve chambers, are separate steel castings, and are held to a closed aluminium crank chamber by lugs on the lower flanges of the cylinders. Copper water jackets are employed, and by the use of a special joint at their lower ends are free to expand and contract. A grooved flange formed on the cylinder contains a rubber ring, over which the jacket is forced by being slightly bell-mouthed. It is stated that the joint thus made is perfectly watertight, while allowing free movement of the jacket. The crank chamber is an aluminium casting, webbed on the inside to provide bearings for the crank-shaft, and having a separate lower portion attached to the casting by aluminium straps; this lower portion forms an oil sump. At one end of the crank-shaft, which is hollow, is a pair of gear wheels that drive the magneto and cam-shaft spindles. These wheels are enclosed by the end plate of the crank chamber, and on this plate is the bracket supporting the magneto and water pump.

Completely enclosing the cam-shaft is an aluminium case, providing bearings for its support, the case being itself supported by four brackets above the cylinders. The inlet and exhaust valves are of the mushroom type, mounted in cylindrical cages, and are held down by aluminium nuts, which form domes over the valve springs. The valves are operated from the cam-shaft by rocking levers pivoted on extensions of the cam-shaft casing. Auxiliary exhaust ports are provided in the cylinder walls just below the water jackets.
Accessibility of the valves has been one of the guiding features in the design. To remove a valve the yoke holding down the valve tappet box is released, and the caps of the brackets supporting the cam-shaft casing are loosened. The cam-shaft casing can then be hinged back sufficiently to clear the valve domes, which, when unscrewed, allow the valves to be lifted out.
The carburetter is of Zenith make, with a separate float chamber.
Lubrication is provided for by a small gear wheel pump driven by an extension of the vertical spindle used for driving the cam-shaft. The pump, which is attached to the end plate of the crank chamber, delivers oil under pressure to a passage cast in the upper part of the crank chamber, which communicates with each of the crank-shaft bearings. Splash lubrication serves for the gudgeons and pistons. Both the magneto and the water pump are driven by a transverse shaft that is skew-driven from the crank-shaft. Provision is made on this engine for fitting either a propeller or a tractor screw, a double thrust bearing being provided for this purpose.
The results of the tests in the Alexander Competition are shown by the accom-panying table of curves. The main points considered in comparing the motors entered for the prize were : (a) Gross weight per measured brake h.p. ; (b) reliability and steadiness of running ; (c) wear of working parts. It will be seen that the Green engine developed a mean brake h.p. of 62 in the first 12 hours' continuous run at 1,155 revolutions per minute, and a mean brake h.p. of 61·2 in the second 12 hours' continuous run at 1,145 revolutions per minute.

This six-cylinder vertical water-cooled engine closely resembles the smaller four-cylinder type in design and construction. One cylinder of the engine has been sectioned so that the working parts may be seen.
The six-throw crank-shaft is of chrome vanadium steel, with the cranks set at 180 degrees. An improvement has been affected in the cooling system by the introduction of a new water-pipe joint at the inlet and outlet points of the cylinder jackets and made flexible without rubber tubing by the use of a special rubber ring. The lubrication is forced and the pressure has also been increased.
The principal data of the engine are : Weight, 450 lb. ; b.h.p., 150 ; bore, 140 mm. ; stroke, 178 mm. ; speed, 1,250 revolutions per minute ; inlet valve opens 4 mm. after top dead centre closes 35 mm. after bottom dead centre ; ex-haust valve opens 20 mm. before bottom dead centre and closes 2 mm. after top dead centre ; ignition occurs 12 mm. before top dead centre.

Object entry information: This is an air-cooled eight-cylinder, V-type engine, and is similar in design to a Renault. It has several improvements, however, the chief of these being the mounting of the crank-shaft and cam-shaft on ball and roller bearings.
Each cylinder is cast integrally with its combustion chamber and valve chamber, and has cooling fins, while it is secured to the crank-case by two long studs passing up to the cylinder head. The pistons are also of cast-iron and each is fitted with three cast-iron rings and a hardened-steel gudgeon pin.
The crank-case is an aluminium casting in two portions, and, as in the case of the Renault, the upper portion carries the crank-shaft, cam-shaft, and cylinders, while the lower part forms the oil base. A light flywheel, mounted on the rear end of the crank-shaft, inside the crank-case, serves to distribute oil to the bearings. This flywheel dips into an oil sump, and throws off the oil into a passage cast in the flywheel housing, whence it runs into an oil duct alongside the crank-case.

The cylinders are cast in blocks of three, and each cylinder is provided with two inlet valves and two exhaust valves of high chrome steel, which are operated by overhead cam-shafts, one to each set of valves, each shaft being driven by a train of gears from the crank-shaft. The connecting-rods are of the articulated pattern, of “H” section nickel chrome steel, and the pistons of aluminium. Lubrication is on the “dry base” principle, and is by gear-wheel pumps, three pumps being fitted. Carburation is effected by four Claudel-Hobson (C.Z.S. 42) carburetters, the petrol feed being by pressure or gravity. Ignition is by means of four B.T.H. (P.M. 6) magnetos furnishing independent sparks for two sparking plugs fitted to each cylinder. The engine is of the water-cooled type, the circulation being maintained by a centrifugal pump, while a special arrangement is also made for the exhaust to be water-cooled, a governor being fitted which automatically cuts off the ignition when the engine reaches a speed of 2,500 revolutions per minute, or when the oil pressure falls below 20 lb. per sq. in. The early types of this engine have two magnetos and covers, inside exhaust pipes, outside carburetters, geared propeller shaft, and air starter mechanism; but later types have four magnetos and covers, inside exhausts, outside carburetters, geared propeller, and air and hand starter. The principal data are: Weight, 1,200 lb.; h.p., 350; normal speed of rotation, 2,000 revolutions per minute; reduction gear ratio, 2 : 1; bore, 110 mm.; stroke, 160 mm.; petrol consumption, 24 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 1.75 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 1a, 5, 5a, 3, 3a, 6, 6a, 2, 2a, 4, 4a; inlet valve opens 3 mm. before top dead centre and closes 20 mm. after bottom dead centre; exhaust valve opens 18 mm. before bottom dead centre and closes 5 mm. after top dead centre; ignition occurs (fully advanced), 17 mm. before top dead centre.

Object entry information: This engine (the Bentley Rotary), which was designed by Captain W. O. Bentley, M.B.E., and produced by Messrs. Humber, Ltd., Coventry, was used extensively towards the end of the war (1914–1918). It is a nine-cylinder rotary air-cooled engine, the cylinders of which are of aluminium shrunk on to cast-iron liners, and arranged radially round a fixed crank-shaft. Each cylinder is provided at its lower end with five shallow stiffening ribs, above which is a series of deep radiating fins. The combustion heads, which are of machined steel, are made in one piece with the induction pockets, into which steel inlet valve guides are pressed, while the exhaust valve cages, into which cast-iron valve guides are pressed, are also in one piece with the heads. The cylinders and combustion heads are attached to the crank-case by four long bolts located at the corners of each cylinder, the cooling fins being cut away to allow clearance. The pistons are of aluminium alloy, have slightly concave heads, and are provided with five very shallow cast-iron rings set in grooves near the top of the piston. Holes are drilled in the piston skirt to allow the oil from inside the piston to escape on to the cylinder walls. The connecting-rods are of tubular section steel, and, with the exception of the master-rod, are bushed with phosphor bronze at both ends. The master rod is bushed with phosphor bronze at the piston end only, its large end riding on two ball-bearings mounted on the crank-pin. Inlet and exhaust valves are both operated by overhead rocker arms and tappets, each of which is connected to a push rod by a ball joint. The cam gear comprises two internally toothed rings known as “gear rings,” within which are the corresponding externally toothed gears. These gears have 16 teeth as against 18 of the “gear rings,” and the gears are thus driven at nine-eighths of engine speed, and overtake the gear rings once in eight revolutions. Each gear has four cams, so that in eight revolutions each tappet is lifted four times, i.e., once in every two revolutions. Forced lubrication is fitted, and oil from the pump is led to an orifice in the crank-shaft, through which it is conducted by a copper pipe to a duct in the base of the rear web of the hollow crank-pin. A bye-pass at the foot of the rear crank-pin supplies oil to the thrust box. The bulk of the oil forced along the pipe inside the crank-shaft travels up the duct in the rear web to the crank-pin, where the stream diverges again into supplies for the connecting-rod assembly, the pistons and the cylinders on the one hand, and for the cam gear-box on the other hand. The Blœctube carburetter is screwed on the extreme rear end of the hollow crank-shaft, through which the explosive mixture passes to the orifice at the foot of the rear web of the crank, whence it passes into the main crank-case. It is then sucked through a ring of holes into the gas chamber, which rotates with the thrust box and through the induction pipes, into the cylinders. Ignition is provided by two M.L. magnetos of the revolving armature type, giving two sparks per revolution. The principal data of the engine are: Normal b.h.p., 150; weight (dry), 408 lb.; normal revolutions per minute, 1,250; bore, 120 mm.; stroke, 170 mm.; petrol consumption, 13 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 1.5 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8. Inlet valve opens 5 degrees before top dead centre and closes 58 degrees after bottom dead centre; exhaust valve opens 72 degrees before bottom dead centre and closes 7 degrees after top dead centre. Ignition occurs at 22.5 degrees before top dead centre.

Each casting forms the cylinder heads, water jackets, valve passages and inlet manifold of three cylinders, into which steel liners are fitted forming the working barrels. Near the level of the combustion chamber the jackets are divided horizontally into two portions, which are bolted together. Leakage is prevented at the base of the aluminium jacket by means of a rubber ring, pressed against a shoulder of the steel liner by a castellated ring-nut screwed into the jacket. The cylinder heads are flat, and each carries a large nickel-steel inlet valve and two smaller tungsten-steel exhaust valves, all operated by a single hollow cam-shaft, the exhaust valves being operated directly and the inlet valves through the agency of a small rocking lever. The pistons are die cast from an aluminium alloy, and each carries three cast-iron rings near the head, and a scraper ring in the skirt. High-tensile steel connecting-rods, machined to H section, connect with the six-cylinder seven-bearing type crank-shaft, the cranks of which are spaced 120 degrees apart. The crank-case is in two portions, the upper portion, which is stiffened by cross webs, is formed integral with the housings of the crank-shaft bearings, and carries the eight supporting feet of the engine, in addition to the main lubrication filter and two breathers. The lower half acts as an oil sump and a cover for the moving parts, and is furnished with sharply inclined gutters, which ensure that the filter remains constantly submerged in oil. Lubrication is by means of two pumps, driven by a vertical shaft, which operates the whole of the accessories. The upper pump draws oil from an external tank, and forces it by way of a filter into a manifold, which, by means of branch pipes, supplies oil to the journal bearings, the thrust housing, the vertical shaft, and the skew gearing operating the magnetos. Oil fed to the main crank-shaft bearings passes into the hollow journals, and by way of holes drilled in the crank-webs, to the crank pins, whence it is flung on to the cylinder walls and the little ends of the connecting-rods. From the front end of the manifold a small pipe conveys oil through the hollow cam-shaft to the cam-shaft bearings, when it is flung on to the cams, rocking levers, and valve heads. Oil which collects in the base of the chamber is drawn out by the second pump and delivered back to the oil tank. Two independent sparking plugs are fitted in each cylinder, one set being connected to a Fellows E.M. 6 type magneto, the second set being served by a small six-volt battery, through a Remy combined contact breaker and distributer mounted at the rear end of the cam-shaft housing, and a coil carried on other magneto platform.

Two independent sparking plugs are fitted in each cylinder, one set being connected to a Fellows E.M. 6 type magneto, the second set being served by a small six-volt battery, through a Remy combined contact breaker and distributer mounted at the rear end of the cam-shaft housing, and a coil carried on other magneto platform. Two Zenith carburetters are fitted. The principal data of the engine are: Normal b.h.p., 246; maximum b.h.p., 255; bore, 145 mm.; stroke, 190 mm.; normal revolutions per minute, 1,400; weight (without cooling water), 625 lb.; oil consumption, 1·8 gallons per hour; petrol consumption, 17 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4; valve timing, inlet valve opens 7 degrees after top dead centre and closes 43 degrees after bottom dead centre; exhaust valve opens 58 degrees before bottom dead centre and closes 12 degrees after top dead centre; ignition occurs at maximum advance, 37½ degrees before top dead centre.

Object entry information: The engine here exhibited is the port engine of the Vickers-Vimy Rolls-Royce aeroplane which made the first direct trans-Atlantic flight on 14th to 15th June, 1919 (see No. 26). The starboard engine remains installed in the aeroplane. It is a 12-cylinder V-type, water-cooled, left-hand tractor engine, in which the two sets of cylinders are arranged at an angle of 60 degrees. The cylinders are of special wrought steel construction, and the pistons, which are specially designed for high compression, are each fitted with four piston rings. There is an oil scraper at the bottom of each piston. The pistons of opposite cylinders are operated by master and articulated connecting-rods respectively and work on a six-throw crank-shaft. Explosive mixture is supplied to the cylinders by four Rolls-Royce Claudel-Hobson carburetters, fitted with a high-altitude control, and ignition is effected by four six-cylinder Watford magnetos, each cylinder being provided with two ignition plugs. A four-bladed tractor airscrew is driven through an epicylic reduction gear of ·6 to 1. The principal data of the engine are: Bore, 4·5 in.; stroke, 6·5 in.; normal b.h.p., 360; weight of engine, 900 lb.; normal speed, 1,800 revolutions per minute; normal airscrew speed, 1,080 revolutions per minute; diameter of

A hollow steel gudgeon-pin is fixed in the piston boss by a single steel set-screw with a conical prolongation. The crank-case, which is in two portions, comprises two steel castings secured together by nine bolts; the cylinders are located by keys, and held by a recess turned in the bottom of each. The inner ends of the cylinders project into the crank-case, and contain a belt of ports, overrun by the piston when near the bottom of its stroke, and thereby functioning as an inlet valve. The massive steel cone-seated exhaust valve, which is situated in the cylinder head, is actuated by a rocker and push rod, the centrifugal effect of which balances that of the valve. An improved form of lubrication is fitted in this type of engine, by means of which the gudgeon bearings are supplied with oil passing outwards from the big end cage along the hollow webs of the connecting-rods, while the oil exuding from the gudgeon bearing is led by two ducts to the cylinder walls. The cam sleeve, cams, and cam-shaft gears are also positively lubricated by oil supplied from the crank-shaft through a series of ducts. The petrol is pressure-fed from the tank to a copper pipe running inside the crank-shaft, thence through the centre of the large crank-web, hollow crank-pin, and small crank-web, to the petrol jet, which is situated in the crank-case, where the mixture is so rich as to be non-explosive.

The end plate, on which the propeller is fixed when used, as in the example, as a tractor screw, carries on the inside the cams and gear-wheels which operate the exhaust valve rods. Ball-bearings are used to support the engine as a whole upon the stationary crank-shaft, and a thrust block is provided at the rear end of the engine. The connecting-rods all operate on a single crank-pin. The big end of one of them, embracing the crank and mounted on ball-bearings, is formed into a cage, the outer rings of which carry the plain bearings for the remaining six connecting-rods. The carburetter, which is stationary, is of the single-jet type, and feeds the engine through the hollow crank-shaft, petrol flowing thence into the crank-chamber, from which each cylinder obtains its mixture by means of an automatic inlet valve of the mushroom type situated in the piston-head. The valve seating also acts as a means of connection between the piston and the connecting-rod. The exhaust valves are situated in the cylinder heads, and are operated by twin balanced rocking levers actuated by long push rods connected with the cams contained in the end plate of the crank-chamber. The cams consist of seven flat steel collars with a common boss keyed on to a spindle and operated by an epicyclic train of wheels, the fixed wheel being on the end of the stationary crank-shaft. Both the inlet and the exhaust valves are balanced against centrifugal force by means of counterweights. An odd number of cylinders is necessary in order that the firing of the mixture in each cylinder may be carried out at equal angular intervals, and thus give an even torque, e.g., if the mixture in cylinder No. 1 was fired first, the order of firing would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, and repeat. Ignition is effected by a Bosch high-tension magneto, mounted on a stationary bracket in an inverted position and driven by gearing. The distribution of the electric current to the sparking-plugs is effected by a revolving commutator plate and a stationary brush. Firing of the charge occurs just before the cylinder concerned reaches its highest position, the piston then being at the top of its stroke. Bare brass wires are employed as connections between the sparking-plugs and the commutator. Lubrication is provided for by a reciprocating pump driven in a similar manner to the magneto, and mounted on the same plate. Castor oil only is used, and is injected into the hollow crank-shaft through sight-feed fittings, and from thence to each cylinder. When running at the normal speed of 1,200 revolutions per minute, the engine develops 50 b.h.p. The ratio of engine weight to horse-power is about 3 : 1.

Object entry information: This engine is a development of the ordinary Gnome engine, and, as its name implies, is provided with only one valve in each cylinder—a mechanically operated exhaust valve situated in the cylinder head. It is a nine-cylinder rotary air-cooled engine, the cylinders being arranged radially and symmetrically round the fixed crank-shaft. The cylinders, which are of nickel chrome steel, are machined from the solid, while the pistons are of cast-iron, each having a thick concave crown connected solidly by webs to the gudgeon-pin bosses. A hollow steel gudgeon-pin is fixed in the piston boss by a single steel set-screw with a conical prolongation.

Renault Frères, France, and was afterwards produced in large numbers by several makers in this country. It may be used either on a tractor or propeller machine, and is an eight-cylinder V-type air-cooled engine, with the two sets of cylinders arranged at an angle of 90 degrees with each other, the cylinders being set directly opposite one another. The cylinders and cylinder heads are separate, both being of cast iron, with air-cooling fins cast on each, and they are secured to the crank-case by means of a clamp, which is held by long studs projecting up from the crank-case. An inlet valve is provided at the side of each cylinder, and works in a valve cage, which also forms the elbow for the inlet pipe, being operated directly by a tappet from the cam-shaft. The exhaust valve works in the cylinder head, and is operated by an overhead rocking lever and push rod. The steel pistons are each fitted with three cast-iron piston rings and a hardened steel gudgeon-pin. Opposite cylinders being in line, the pressure from the pistons of both is taken on one big end, one piston being fitted with the main rod and the other with an auxiliary rod, which transmits its pressure by the lower end working on a hardened steel pin attached to the main big end. The four-throw crank-shaft is carried in five bearings, the centre and two intermediate ones being gun-metal lined with white metal, and the outer ones ball bearings. The crank-case is of aluminium, and is divided into two portions horizontally along the centre line of the crank-shaft, the upper portion containing the bearings, cam-shaft, and gears, and the lower portion forming an oil base and carrying the oil pump, strainer, and oil-pressure release valve. A breather is fitted on the top of the crank-case between the cylinders. The engine is fitted with a Claudel-Hobson carburetter of the R.A.F. type, and an eight-cylinder B.T.H. A.8-type magneto.

Object entry information: The crank-case, which is in two portions, comprises two steel castings secured together by nine bolts; the cylinders are located by keys, and held by a recess turned in the bottom of each. The inner ends of the cylinders project into the crank-case, and contain a belt of ports, overrun by the piston when near the bottom of its stroke, and thereby functioning as an inlet valve. The massive steel cone-seated exhaust valve, which is situated in the cylinder head, is actuated by a rocker and push rod, the centrifugal effect of which balances that of the valve. An improved form of lubrication is fitted in this type of engine, by means of which the gudgeon bearings are supplied with oil passing outwards from the big end cage along the hollow webs of the connecting-rods, while the oil exuding from the gudgeon bearing is led by two ducts to the cylinder walls. The cam sleeve, cams, and cam-shaft gears are also positively lubricated by oil supplied from the crank-shaft through a series of ducts. The petrol is pressure-fed from the tank to a copper pipe running inside the crank-shaft, thence through the centre of the large crank-web, hollow crank-pin, and small crank-web, to the petrol jet, which is situated in the crank-case, where the mixture is so rich as to be non-explosive. Air is admitted into the cylinder through the exhaust valve, while the rich mixture enters by way of the belt of ports at the inner end of the cylinder. A Bosch magneto of the D.A.L. type is fitted. The principal data of the engine are: Normal b.h.p., 105; weight, 297 lb.; speed, 1,200 revolutions per minute; bore, 110 mm.; stroke, 150 mm.; petrol consumption, 10 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 2 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8 (the cylinders are numbered 1 to 9 consecutively, in a clockwise direction when facing the propeller). Cylinder ports open 20 degrees before bottom dead centre and close 20 degrees after bottom dead centre; exhaust valve opens 85 degrees after top dead centre and closes 60 degrees before bottom dead centre (the exhaust valve being open continuously during 395 degrees of rotation). Ignition occurs 18 degrees before top dead centre.

Object entry information: The “Salmson” aero engines, invented jointly by MM. Canton and Unné, are manufactured on the Continent by the Société Anonyme des Moteurs “Salmson,” of Billancourt, Seine, and in Great Britain by the Dudbridge Iron Works, Ltd., of Stroud, Gloucester. The engine here exhibited is a nine-cylinder water-cooled engine of the radial type. The cylinders, which are placed symmetrically around the crank-shaft, are of nickel steel machined from solid forgings, the finished thickness of the working barrels being 2 mm. The flat-topped combustion chambers carry bosses into which the casings of the mechanically operated inlet and exhaust valves are screwed. Water jackets of spun copper are brazed to the cylinders and corrugated to permit the working barrels to expand freely. The flat-topped cast-iron pistons are each fitted with three cast-iron spring rings, and are secured by hollow tungsten steel gudgeon-pins to H section steel connecting-rods, all of which operate on one crank-pin by means of a steel cage or connecting rod carrier. The aluminium crank-case is in halves, between which the cylinders are securely clamped and from which the cam-box is detachable. The lubrication is forced, a double pump being fitted below the cam-box; one pump draws oil from the crank-case sump, and delivers it to an external reservoir, where it is cooled, and from where it is drawn by the other pump through a fine wire gauze filtering screen to a sight feed box, whence it is delivered by means of the crank-shaft and cam-box to the big ends, and by exudation to the pistons and gudgeon-pins. Two specially designed Zenith carburetters placed on the horizontal axis of the engine, deliver the explosive mixture through hot-water jacket branches into an annular mixing chamber, and thence by the induction pipes to the several cylinders, in which ignition is effected by a Siemens’ magneto. The engine drives through a reduction gear of 9 to 5, thereby allowing a propeller of larger diameter to be employed. The data of the engine are:—Weight, 360 lb. without radiator; normal b.h.p., 130 h.p.; bore, 4.73 in.; stroke, 5.52 in.; normal rational speed, 1,250 revolutions per minute; angle between cylinders, 40 degrees; petrol consumption, 9.5 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 0.5 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8. Inlet valve opens 1 to 2 mm. before top dead centre and closes 18 to 20 mm. after bottom dead centre. Exhaust valve opens 18 to 20 mm. before bottom dead centre and closes 1 to 2 mm. before top dead centre. Ignition occurs 12 to 13 mm. before top dead centre.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Disposal Board, Ministry of Munitions, 1920
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The engine here exhibited is a typical example of the various types produced by the Curtiss Motor Co., and used largely in America. It is an eight-cylinder V-type water-cooled engine divided into two groups of four cylinders set at 90 degrees. The cast-iron cylinders, which are cast separately, are each attached to the crank-case by eight short studs and four long through bolts, the latter being secured at the top to a bridge or yoke fitting over the cylinder heads. The cast-iron valves having electro-welded steel stems are located in the cylinder heads, and are operated by push rods and rocker arms from a single hollow cam-shaft in the crank-case between the cylinders, the push rods operating the exhaust valves being within tubular push rods operating the inlet valves. The valves, guides, and seats are cast integral with the cylinders, and the combustion chamber is nearly hemispherical. The water jackets are made of ""monel,"" a non-corrosive combination of nickel and copper, and are oxyacetylene welded to the cylinder walls, the whole of the cylinder and jacket being nickel plated. The cooling water is circulated by means of a centrifugal pump, mounted on an extension of the crank-shaft projecting through the crank-case. Lubrication is effected by means of a force pump driven by bevel gearing from a wheel formed integral with the crank-shaft. The pump forces oil through the crank-shaft to the five main bearings, and through the cam-shaft to the latter's bearings, while oil slingers are fitted at each end of the crank-shaft. The lower half of the crank-case is divided into four compartments, which serve as an oil reservoir having a capacity of six hours' flight. The Berling D-81 magneto is mounted between the cylinders, and is driven from the cam-shaft gearing. A Schebler carburetter is fitted. The principal data of the engine are: Normal b.h.p., 90; weight, 325 lb.; bore, 4 in.; stroke, 5 in.; normal speed, 1,200 revolutions per minute; maximum speed, 1,450 revolutions per minute; petrol consumption, 7 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 0.25 gallon per hour. The order of firing of the cylinders is 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6; inlet valve closes 13/32 in. after bottom dead centre, exhaust valve opens 11/16 in. before bottom dead centre. Ignition occurs when fully advanced 0.5 in. before top dead centre.

Object entry information: This is a six-cylinder, vertical, water-cooled engine of German design.
Each cylinder is built up of a thin steel barrel into the top of which is screwed the cast-iron cylinder head, in which the valve guides are fitted with cast-iron bushes pressed into position. The water jackets are machined from cylindrical steel forgings, which are screwed on to a flange machined on the cylinder head, and extend for about two-thirds of the length of the cylinder barrel.
The pistons are of cast iron and each is fitted with four piston rings above the gudgeon-pin, the lower one being a scraper ring, while an oil groove is cut on the piston skirt below the gudgeon-pin, evidently to assist the scraper ring and the piston lubrication. The connecting-rods, which are of square section, bevelled at the four corners and bored up the centre from the big end, connect with an ordinary six-throw crank-shaft, an extension at the rear end of which carried the wireless dynamo driving pulley, which embodies a friction clutch.
The aluminium crank-case is cast in two portions, the upper end of which supports the bottom halves of the crank-shaft main bearings by bolts, which also serve to bolt down the cylinders by means of triangular clamps. The lower portion of the crank-case which serves as a base chamber carries the small detach- able oil sumps, together with the three oil pumps. The oil is delivered under pressure from the rearmost pump to the crank-shaft journal bearings through an external oil main along the induction side of the engine, and is fed to the journal bearings through oil ways drilled diagonally in the crank-case casting through the transverse webs. Oil scoops bolted to the outer sides of each crank-web serve to collect the oil which is forced through the journal bearings and in this way lubricate the crank-pins and small end bearings.
The two scavenger pumps, situated one at either end of the base chamber, are designed so as to draw off the return oil which collects in the small detachable oil sumps, and return it to the tank. Two Bosch Z.H. 6 magnetos are provided and effect dual ignition, two plugs being fitted in the head of each cylinder.
The principal data of the engine are: b.h.p., 290; revolutions per minute, 1,400; petrol consumption, 20 gallons; oil consumption, 11 pints; order of firing, 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4; inlet valve opens 8 degrees before top dead centre, closes 35 degrees after bottom dead centre; exhaust valve opens 33 degrees before bottom dead centre, closes 7 degrees after; magneto advance, 38 degrees before top dead centre.

Compressed air is supplied from a compressor (not shown), and is fed to the six cylinders through a simple type of rotary valve. A ratchet device makes the starter inoperative when the engine is running. A starting magneto (not shown) is mounted at the top of the casting, and is driven at high speed by suitable gearing.
The aluminium casting, which comprises the cylinders, the crank-case, and the mounting for the starting magneto, is bolted to the rear of the engine in such a manner that the centre ball-bearing embraces the end of the crank-shaft and the ratchet wheel engages with suitable stops attached thereto.
The engine starter is single-acting; compressed air is admitted through a plate bolted over the valve mechanism, and enters the various ports as they are uncovered by the slot in the rotating disc. From thence it passes up the channels in the castings to the cylinder heads. Exhaust is by means of ports, which are uncovered when the pistons descend. The starting magneto (not shown) is driven in such a manner that adequate current is provided for firing purposes at the lowest speed. The geared-up shaft projects, and is squared to take a handle, thus enabling the starter and engine shaft to be revolved by hand.

Object entry information: This is a sectioned example of the A.V. 8 S. type of polar inductor magneto. It is suitable for an eight-cylinder aircraft engine. Examples of the materials used in construction are shown adjacent. This type of magneto has a stationary armature and a rotor consisting of four iron masses mounted upon a ""straight-through"" shaft of non-magnetic steel. The current which produces the spark is generated in the stationary armature, and reaches its maximum four times during each revolution of the rotor or polar inductor; accordingly four sparks are produced per revolution. The masses of iron which form the polar inductor are alternately North and South poles, so that in sweeping past the ends or poles of the laminated circuit, they cause, on each occasion, a reversion in the flux. The beginning of the primary winding is connected to the armature core and the end to the secondary winding and to the contact breaker. A cam operates the rocker arm, separating the contacts four times per revolution of the shaft. When the contacts are closed the primary winding is short-circuited, and, as the inductor rotates, the current induced in the primary winding builds up until the cam separates the contacts at the instant when this current is at a maximum. The instantaneous collapse and reversal of the flux at the moment of ""break"" produces the high voltage in the secondary winding which causes the spark. The distributor consists of a rotating metal brush, which conveys the high-tension current to the various segments; the sparks are thus distributed to the various plugs on the engine. A condenser is fitted above the armature, and a safety spark gap is provided between a point on the metal brush-box and a stud on the half-speed gear wheel. The inductor shaft is driven at engine speed.

This type of magneto has a stationary armature and a rotor consisting of four iron masses mounted upon a ""straight-through"" shaft of non-magnetic steel. The current which produces the spark is generated in the stationary armature, and reaches its maximum four times during each revolution of the rotor or polar inductor; accordingly four sparks are produced per revolution. The masses of iron which form the polar inductor are alternately North and South poles, so that in sweeping past the ends or poles of the laminated circuit, they cause, on each occasion, a reversion in the flux. The beginning of the primary winding is connected to the armature core and the end to the secondary winding and to the contact breaker. A cam operates the rocker arm, separating the contacts four times per revolution of the shaft. When the contacts are closed the primary winding is short-circuited, and, as the inductor rotates, the current induced in the primary winding builds up until the cam separates the contacts at the instant when this current is at a maximum. The instantaneous collapse and reversal of the flux at the moment of ""break"" produces the high voltage in the secondary winding which causes the spark. The distributor consists of a rotating metal brush, which conveys the high-tension current to the various segments; the sparks are thus distributed to the various plugs on the engine.

Maker/Donor: Presented by The Air Council.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: This sparking-plug is designed for a stationary air-cooled aero engine. It is made with large surface radiating fins to assist in the cooling, and so maintain a temperature which will not cause pre-ignition. The plug has a six-point spark gap. The central rod terminates in a star-shaped electrode of six points. It is insulated from the body of the plug by a mica cylinder, and the whole is held in position by a screw collar, which, with an asbestos washer, forms a gas-tight joint. This sparking-plug is designed to withstand, by means of a large radiating surface, the very high temperature which a stationary air-cooled engine attains.

Object entry information: Three types of sectioned K.L.G. sparking-plugs are shown. These plugs were specially manufactured by the Robinhood Engineering Works, Ltd., for use on various types of aircraft engines. No. 1 is suitable for a water-cooled engine. No. 2 is designed to withstand great heat, being used on the Rolls-Royce engines during the first Atlantic and Australian flights. No. 3 is particularly suitable for engines such as the Sunbeam ""Maori,"" having a very high-compression ratio, and it is stated to be capable of enduring the highest temperatures. No. 1 is the model F. 7. It has electrodes of white metal and a single-spark gap. The centre rod is insulated from the body of the plug by mica, placed vertically as well as horizontally. The securing member is of brass, being screwed upon an asbestos washer to maintain a gas-tight joint. No. 2 is the model F. 12. It is similar in design to F. 7, but is heavier in construction and capable of withstanding a higher compression. One of these plugs unsectioned is shown adjacent. No. 3 is the type C.B. It differs considerably from the other models, having a centre rod of copper and a very complete insulation of mica which fills the body of the plug. The upper part of the rod is surrounded with mica placed vertically in addition to the ordinary insulation. The rod increases gradually in size towards the bottom, so that an increase in pressure only serves to tighten the joint. Radiating fins are provided to assist in the cooling of the rod and electrode.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: This is an example of the well-known carburetter manufactured by the Zenith Carburetter Co., and used extensively with aero engines. The chief characteristic is the fitting of an auxiliary or compensating jet in addition to the main jet. It has also a slow-running device and removable choke tube. The carburetter shown is suitable for a four-cylinder engine. The main jet is fitted in the centre of the compensating jet, being inserted from beneath when the plug is removed. It is fed directly from the float chamber. The compensating jet is inserted from above, and can be seen in position covering the main jet. The bore of each jet is marked on it in hundredths of a millimeter, so that a very fine adjustment can be effected by discriminate changing. The slow-running device consists of a small jet situated in a tube, which is part of the carburetter casting, and adjacent to the main intake. It has an air intake above it, through two holes in the casting, which can be plainly seen. At low-engine speeds, when the throttle, which is of the ordinary central-pivoted type, is almost closed, the slow-running device comes into operation and gases are sucked into the main intake from the small jet through a passage above the throttle. In this position the main and compensating jets are practically shut off, and the partial vacuum induced by the engine has its full effect upon the small jet. As the throttle is opened the slow-running device is progressively cut out. The mixture is kept more or less constant at all speeds by means of the compensating jet, which corrects the irregularities of the main jet; it has a greater influence at low speeds, while the main jet has most effect at high speeds. Adjustment is effected by changing the choke tube, the main and compensating jets, and regulating the slow-running device. An advantage of this carburetter is that, when once properly adjusted, it requires no attention, unless the conditions of service are radically altered.

Object entry information: This shutter was designed by Captain L. C. Bygrave for the shielding of radiators when exposed to very low temperatures. The effect of a low temperature on an uncovered radiator is to cause over-cooling and consequent loss of engine efficiency. The shutter consists of a series of metal strips pivoted laterally and arranged in the manner of the slats on a Venetian blind. The maximum opening is when the strips are horizontal, and in this position the radiator has the full benefit of the cooling draft induced by its passage through the air and by any head wind which may be blowing. If over-cooling takes place the shutter may be partially or completely closed by means of the control in the pilot's cockpit. This device is often found useful in the intial stages of a flight, when it is desired to heat up the engine quickly.

Object entry information: This shutter was designed by Captain L. C. Bygrave for the shielding of radiators when exposed to very low temperatures. The effect of a low temperature on an uncovered radiator is to cause over-cooling and consequent loss of engine efficiency.

The instrument is electrically illuminated, and the markings are treated with radium compound to enable readings to be taken should the light fail. The compass is fitted with an inclined ring card graduated on the inside to read against a forward ""lubber line.""

A device is provided to allow for expansion. The liquid is introduced to give a damping effect to the card and needles. The period of this compass is quick and ""dead-beat,"" so that readings taken during, or immediately after, a turn are quite reliable. The compass case is mounted in a box fitted with springs in order to insulate it as far as possible from shocks and vibration. In order to correct for the deviation caused by the presence of iron near the compass, a device is fitted above the chamber consisting of tubes mounted at right angles to one another in the horizontal plane and shut off by a rotating sleeve. Small ""wire"" compensating magnets (marked half red and half blue for the N. and S. poles respectively) are placed in these tubes, according to the correction required, and locked therein by the rotating sleeve. It is not possible to achieve absolute correction in this manner. A compass similar to the one shown, but of the ""slow-period"" type, is also made.

Object entry information: This air-speed indicator differs from an ordinary air-speed indicator in having a connection to a suction tube only, which is set in a forward direction. The instrument comprises essentially a flat metal chamber, one end of which is formed by a corrugated metal diaphragm. The suction tube connects with the interior of the chamber, so that the pressure within the chamber is regulated by the air-speed. Any variation of pressure causes a movement of the diaphragm, to the centre of which is connected an axial arm, which by means of a quadrant transfers its motion to an axial shaft which is thereby caused to rotate. This shaft carries the pointer, which moves over a suitably graduated scale.

Any variation of pressure causes a movement of the diaphragm, to the centre of which is connected an axial arm, which by means of a quadrant transfers its motion to an axial shaft which is thereby caused to rotate. This shaft carries the pointer, which moves over a suitably graduated scale.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Air Ministry,
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: This instrument is designed to calculate the amount of drift and the actual ground-speed for the purpose of aerial navigation. The angle of drift is easily ascertained by viewing an object through the celluloid and along the drift wire, and adjusting the latter until no deviation is apparent. The ground-speed is calculated by timing the aircraft over a distance on the ground which is known when viewed through the sights. The device consists of two rotating concentric rings and a middle ring, which constitutes the base plate, and is furnished with a securing bracket, which engages a fixed shoe on the aircraft. The inner ring is in the form of a dial, graduated in degrees and showing the cardinal points. The outer or sight-ring carries the forward and back sights ; it also carries a pivoted vertical arm, graduated in hundreds and thousands of feet, with a back sight adjustable for height. A drift wire is fitted along the centre of this arm. The inner ring or bearing plate is set by the compass on the aircraft ; the outer ring is then rotated till an object on the ground passes evenly along the drift wire, indicating that it agrees with the ground drift. The angle of ground drift, or actual track made good, can then be read off at the pointer, carried by the sights, against the bearing plate. In order to ascertain the ground speed it is necessary to adjust the movable back sight, thus altering the angle of view through the fore sight in proportion to the height of the machine above the ground. This gives a constant base line on the ground of half a statute mile. The time taken for any object to pass from the fore sight (viewed through the movable back sight) to the back sight is the time taken by the aircraft to cover this distance. A stop watch is employed to register the period.

In order to use the protractor, the large milled head is turned till the engraved arrow lies coincident with the magnetic meridian of the compass rose on the chart. The back screw is then eased, and the metal pointer is set to zero and reclamped ; it then indicates magnetic direction. To maintain any particular course, the protractor is turned till the pointer indicates the required angle ; it is then clamped by the small screw in the centre. The protractor will now record the desired angle wherever it is moved on the chart, and the course can be marked on the celluloid cover. In order to measure distance, the sides of the protractor are graduated in inches and tenths and numbered, in the direction of the arrow, from the departure point to the objective. The distance in inches and tenths is multiplied by the scale of the chart—in the case of a general chart by 10, which is the number of nautical miles to the inch. The protractor is equally available for maps where the scale is some fraction or multiple of an inch.

Object entry information: The object of this instrument is to warn the pilot when a water-cooled engine is in danger of overheating, and whether there is any loss, by boiling, in the water-cooling system. It consists of a small cylinder connected by air-tight tubing to a Bourdon pressure gauge. The cylinder is usually immersed in the radiator water, but it is sometimes fitted in the cooling jacket of the engine. It contains ether in both liquid and vaporous state. As the temperature of the water rises, the vapour pressure in the cylinder increases, and is registered by the Bourdon gauge. The scale is graduated to read up to 100° C., and as the boiling point of water decreases with height and reduced pressure, a red marking (indicating that at 10,000 ft. the boiling point is 93°) is provided to prevent any error on this account.

It was originally calibrated on a motor-car, and afterwards used on the airships “Beta” and “Gamma,” and also on the first B.E. aeroplane. The head of the instrument consists of two long parallel tubes, one being a pressure tube and the second being connected with a small annular chamber provided with a number of small holes connecting with the atmosphere. The rush of air past this series of holes causes a suction in the tube in connection with this chamber. The indicator consists of two small chambers separated by a diaphragm, each chamber being in connection with one tube of the pressure head. Any difference in pressure in the two tubes is communicated to the diaphragm, which moves accordingly, and operates a spring-controlled arm connected thereto, which in turn actuates the pointer.

Object entry information: The speed of aircraft in relation to the air is measured from the difference between the atmospheric pressure and that induced by the speed of flight. The instrument shown is of the Ogilvie type, and indicates this speed in miles per hour. It is connected with the pressure head adjacent. Two tubes from the pressure head are connected to the gauge and the pressure difference, which amounts to approximately 5 in. head of water at 100 miles per hour, deflects metal diaphragms in the instrument, the movement being communicated to the pointer by suitable gearing. The indicator only reads true air speed near the ground level, for at a height the reduction of air density causes the readings to be low. In order to correct for this, a computing ring is fitted, by means of which the true air speed may be calculated from the indicated speed. As set, the scales record a true air speed of 81 miles per hour, which at 10,000 ft. corresponds to an indicated speed of 70 miles per hour.

Object name: AIR-SPEED INDICATOR WITH COMPUTING RING.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Air Ministry,
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: The speed of aircraft in relation to the air is measured from the difference between the atmospheric pressure and that induced by the speed of flight. The instrument shown is of the Ogilvie type, and indicates this speed in miles per hour. It is connected with the pressure head adjacent. Two tubes from the pressure head are connected to the gauge and the pressure difference, which amounts to approximately 5 in. head of water at 100 miles per hour, deflects metal diaphragms in the instrument, the movement being communicated to the pointer by suitable gearing. The indicator only reads true air speed near the ground level, for at a height the reduction of air density causes the readings to be low. In order to correct for this, a computing ring is fitted, by means of which the true air speed may be calculated from the indicated speed. As set, the scales record a true air speed of 81 miles per hour, which at 10,000 ft. corresponds to an indicated speed of 70 miles per hour.

Object entry information: This was the first air-speed indicator for aircraft employing the principle of the rise of air pressure due to the velocity, above the pressure in a static box. It was originally calibrated on a motor-car, and afterwards used on the airships “Beta” and “Gamma,” and also on the first B.E. aeroplane. The head of the instrument consists of two long parallel tubes, one being a pressure tube and the second being connected with a small annular chamber provided with a number of small holes connecting with the atmosphere. The rush of air past this series of holes causes a suction in the tube in connection with this chamber. The indicator consists of two small chambers separated by a diaphragm, each chamber being in connection with one tube of the pressure head. Any difference in pressure in the two tubes is communicated to the diaphragm, which moves accordingly, and operates a spring-controlled arm connected thereto, which in turn actuates the pointer.

Object entry information: This instrument consists of two tubes, known as the "" static "" and "" pitot "" tubes respectively. The static tube is closed at the end, and has small holes at the sides communicating with the outer air. Pressure inside this tube is not affected by its passage through the air. The pitot tube is open at the end and is arranged to face up stream. It records the atmospheric pressure plus the additional pressure produced by the speed of flight and the wind. The pressure difference between the two tubes is proportional to the density of the air and the square of the velocity of the machine.

Object entry information: This form of air-speed indicator, which was used considerably by the Germans during the war (1914-18), closely resembles the Ogilvie air-speed indicator. This instrument consists of a large metal chamber, divided into two portions by a partition carrying a rubber diaphragm. Increased pressure in one of these chambers, which is connected to the pressure tube of a pitot head, causes a motion of the rubber diaphragm, which is augmented by a corresponding decrease of pressure in the other chamber, which is in connection with the suction tube of the pitot head. The motion of the rubber diaphragm is transmitted through a quadrant to a spindle carrying the pointer, which is thus caused to travel along the graduated scale.

Object entry information: This instrument is principally used to warn the pilot when his machine is side-slipping. It is sometimes employed to indicate whether the aeroplane is keeping a steady, straight flight. It consists of a curved glass tube filled with a non-freezing solution; a bubble of air is imprisoned at the centre of the column of liquid. When mounted laterally in the aeroplane the bubble will, owing to centrifugal force, take up a central position during a turn if the machine is correctly "" banked."" If the aeroplane is under-banked, the bubble will move to the inside of the turn; in the case of an over-bank, to the outside. When mounted longitudinally, the spirit-level indicates any deviation from steady horizontal flight. An illuminating attachment for night flying is provided.

Object entry information: This case contains a duplicate set of the instruments used in the Vickers-Vimy biplane on the first direct trans-Atlantic flight. The original instruments remain in position in the machine. 1. Pitot Tube.—The pitot tube or pressure head is fitted to the outer interplane strut of the machine and is connected to the instrument by means of rubber or aluminium tubing. The open end is connected to the pressure side of the diaphragm, whilst the closed end is connected to the opposite side of the diaphragm, its purpose being to keep the air at atmospheric pressure on this side of the diaphragm. 2. Density Meter.—This instrument is used to correct the ordinary air-speed indicator for the variation in altitude and temperature. The ordinary air-speed indicator under-registers on height, due to the diminished density of the atmosphere, and the density meter is calibrated in numbers, which, when multiplied by the M.P.H. shown on the ordinary air-speed indicator dial, gives the combined correction for variation of both altitude and temperature. 3. Pressure Gauge.—These pressure gauges are of the usual Bourdon tube type, and are made for any ranges from 5–160 lb. All gauges are fitted for over-load, to stand any extra pressure above which they are designed to register. 4. Radiator Thermometer.—This instrument indicates the temperature of the water in the engine cooling system, and depends for its action on the expansion of the ether in the bulb and tubing of the instrument. The expansion causes a pressure which is registered on the dial in degrees of temperature. The boiling point of water drops as the altitude increases, therefore a correction is necessary and can be made by referring to the boiling-point altimeter. 5. Longitudinal Clinometer.—This instrument is fitted with a tube containing greenish-yellow liquid, making it easy to read in semi-darkness. A certain quantity of the liquid is sealed in the tube and rises half-way up it, indicating zero degrees when the machine is flying level ; when the machine is climbing the liquid rises in the tube, and vice versâ when the machine descends. 6. Revolution Indicator.—This instrument is worked on the centrifugal principle, and indicates the engine revolutions in hundreds per minute. The connection to the engine is by means of a flexible drive, which is arranged by means of a gear box on the engine to run at quarter engine speed, the instrument itself being geared 4–1, enabling it to record the actual revolutions of the crank-shaft. 7. Scout Compass, Type 5/17.—This is the standard scout compass, and was used extensively during the war (1914–18). There is no float in this type of instrument, and the card is attached by a wire framework, carrying the magnetic system, to the pivot. The bearing is therefore extremely light, and the liquid has the maximum steadying effect on quick turns of the machine. 8. Air-Speed Indicator.—This instrument depends for its action on the movement of a specially treated silk diaphragm, which is unaffected by moisture or atmospheric conditions. The characteristic of this air-speed indicator lies in the fact that the diaphragm is not called upon to do any work, except that of a diaphragm ; that is to say, it is a mover only, the resistance to the movement being supplied by a highly tempered steel spring.

Object name: BOMB SIGHT, HIGH ALTITUDE DRIFT, MARK. I.A.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Air Ministry.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: When a bomb is released from an aeroplane, it appears, to the observer on the ground, to describe a curve in the direction of the machine’s motion. A bomb sight is a device which enables a bomb to be so released that the target will be in the path of the curve described by it. It also indicates the right direction to steer when approaching the target and any lateral drift which may occur. The bomb sight shown can be used for bombing up or down wind at high altitudes, and is adjustable for bombs stowed vertically or horizontally.
The principal of the bomb sight is based upon the solution of the triangle formed by the aircraft in flight, a point on the ground vertically beneath it, and the target. The ground speed of the aircraft and its height are the chief factors to be considered in determining when the bomb is to be released. The effect of air resistance on the motion of the bomb is slight, but allowances are made for it in the construction of the instrument. The foresight (A on the illustration exhibited) is adjusted for altitude by means of the lever (D), whose pointer reads against the height scale. The backsights (B and C) are adjusted for speed. They are carried on a rod, which is movable along its own axis, the setting being given by index (K) against the speed scale. They are also operated by turning the milled head (G), and are thus set for wind by the wind scale marked on this head. The addition or subtraction of the wind from the air speed is then performed by the linkage and the ground speed is obtained. The backsight (B) is marked “Down,” and gives the line of sight for dropping down wind ; the other backsight (C) is marked “Up,” and is for dropping up wind.
The wind can, at low altitudes, be measured or checked by means of the drift bar (F). The machine is flown up or down wind, as convenient, so that no lateral drift is observable and the sight is adjusted for air speed. The course is then changed through about 90 degrees, and the milled head (G) turned until the drift bar (F) is parallel to earth drift. The backsights are then correctly set, and the strength of the wind can be read on the scale (G).
The line for the target during the run up is given by the direction wire (W), and if the operator’s eye is placed so that the bubble of the transverse level is bisected by the direction wire, his line of sight is in the vertical plane. The bomb is released when the target appears on the line of vision through the back and forward sights.
This sight being intended for use over land, is scaled in miles. The height is adjustable from 1,000 to 18,000 ft., the air speed from 60 to 130 miles per hour, and the wind from zero to 50 miles per hour.

Object name: BOMB SIGHT, HIGH ALTITUDE DRIFT, MARK. I.A.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Air Ministry.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: When a bomb is released from an aeroplane, it appears, to the observer on the ground, to describe a curve in the direction of the machine’s motion. A bomb sight is a device which enables a bomb to be so released that the target will be in the path of the curve described by it. It also indicates the right direction to steer when approaching the target and any lateral drift which may occur. The bomb sight shown can be used for bombing up or down wind at high altitudes, and is adjustable for bombs stowed vertically or horizontally.
The principal of the bomb sight is based upon the solution of the triangle formed by the aircraft in flight, a point on the ground vertically beneath it, and the target. The ground speed of the aircraft and its height are the chief factors to be considered in determining when the bomb is to be released. The effect of air resistance on the motion of the bomb is slight, but allowances are made for it in the construction of the instrument. The foresight (A on the illustration exhibited) is adjusted for altitude by means of the lever (D), whose pointer reads against the height scale. The backsights (B and C) are adjusted for speed. They are carried on a rod, which is movable along its own axis, the setting being given by index (K) against the speed scale. They are also operated by turning the milled head (G), and are thus set for wind by the wind scale marked on this head. The addition or subtraction of the wind from the air speed is then performed by the linkage and the ground speed is obtained. The backsight (B) is marked “Down,” and gives the line of sight for dropping down wind ; the other backsight (C) is marked “Up,” and is for dropping up wind.
The wind can, at low altitudes, be measured or checked by means of the drift bar (F). The machine is flown up or down wind, as convenient, so that no lateral drift is observable and the sight is adjusted for air speed. The course is then changed through about 90 degrees, and the milled head (G) turned until the drift bar (F) is parallel to earth drift. The backsights are then correctly set, and the strength of the wind can be read on the scale (G).
The line for the target during the run up is given by the direction wire (W), and if the operator’s eye is placed so that the bubble of the transverse level is bisected by the direction wire, his line of sight is in the vertical plane. The bomb is released when the target appears on the line of vision through the back and forward sights.
This sight being intended for use over land, is scaled in miles. The height is adjustable from 1,000 to 18,000 ft., the air speed from 60 to 130 miles per hour, and the wind from zero to 50 miles per hour.

The height scale on the calculator (Höhe) is now adjusted from the altimeter, which brings the appropriate height scale (Gestoppte Zeit in Sekunden) into position.

Object entry information: The sight is provided with adjustment for height and for indicated air-speed. It is fitted with a pivoted wind bar, which can be set along any wind direction. For this purpose a compass is embodied in it, connected by gearing to the wind bar in such a manner that the wind arrow (D.B.), attached to the compass case, lies parallel to the wind bar and points down wind.
Surrounding the compass case is a bearing plate, graduated in degrees and showing the points. By means of two clamps the bearing plate may be released and turned, independently of the wind arrow, in order to register the direction of the wind. When clamped they turn together, and, provided the north point of the bearing plate agrees with the north point of the compass, the wind bar lies truly along the wind. Bombing may, therefore, be carried out in any direction.
The line of sight is given by a ring backsight (in duplicate) on the slider, which is set for height; and by a foresight, carried on the wind bar, its distance from the axis of the height bar being proportional to the ground speed.
The sight is set for wind (unless its strength and direction are already known), by adjusting for air-speed and by flying dead up wind, with the wind bar in the neutral position, i.e. with the tail of the wind arrow (D.B.) under the air-speed bar pointer (A.B.). When no drift is discernible, the bearing plate is unclamped and turned to agree with the compass needle (red on red) and reclamped. The course is then changed through, approximately, 90 degrees, and the compass case turned till red is on red. The wind scale is then adjusted until the direction of drift is seen to be along the drift bar. The strength and direction of the wind are thus recorded.
When the sight is adjusted for height, and levelled up by means of the adjustment on the left, it is ready for operating in any direction, provided that the north point on the bearing plate is always made to agree with the compass needle. The target is caused to approach along the drift bar, and the bomb is released when the sights come on.
The wind bar is graduated to show the ground-speed in knots, and also the number of minutes required to travel 10 nautical miles at that speed.
A device for correcting the deviation of the compass needle is fitted at the base of the instrument.

Object entry information: This German periscopic bomb sight is the most recent type of bomb-sighting instrument manufactured by C. P. Goerz, who concentrated on its production during the latter part of the war (1914-1918). It was used on the Gotha bombing aeroplanes.
The basis of the sight is a telescope, lengthened by the introduction of a periscopic system, and provided at its lower end with a rotating prism, whereby objects ahead of the aircraft may be conveniently observed in a field of view of 30 degrees diameter, the magnification being approximately 1.5. A diagram of the optical system may be seen adjacent.
The sight is mounted with its axis vertical. The main tube is encircled at its lower end by gimbals which are carried by a base plate screwed to the floor of the aircraft, through which the rotating prisms project. The rotation of the prisms is effected by a worm and wheel, the worm being set on a spindle which extends up the sighting tube and terminates on a cam-follower. The cam, of spiral form, is cut on a large disc mounted on the side of the tube, and carries about its circumference a scale of angles to be read against a fixed index on the casing. A milled hand-grip serves to rotate the cam and a movable index is provided to be clamped at any desired angle setting; it drops into a notch when it passes the fixed index. By rotating the cam, any object at from 75 degrees before to five degrees behind the vertical may be brought to the centre of the field. The line of sight is through the zero of the eye-piece graticule and the centre of the internal level bubble; the bomb is dropped when these coincide on the target, the gimbals making it possible to hold the sighting tube so that the bubble is central whatever the slope of the floor. A mounting for a stop watch and a calculator of ground-speeds and dropping angles are provided on the casing.
The procedure in bomb dropping is as follows: In order to ascertain the bombing angle the prism rotating disc is turned until the index points to 22.5 degrees (distinguished in red) on the angle scale; the watch is started when the timing target is along the line of sight. The angle scale is then turned until the index points to -5 degrees, and the watch is stopped when the timing target again appears along the line of sight. Tan 22.5 degrees plus tan 5 degrees = 0.5, so that a ground distance of half the altitude has been timed over.

Object entry information: This was the first type of aerial camera used by the Royal Flying Corps early in 1915, and was designed by officers of the corps. Previously, ordinary press cameras had been employed. This camera consists of a brass-bound metal conical box with a recessed wooden front to which the lens is fixed, the extension of the camera body acting as a mechanical protection and as a shade for the lens, while at the back is the shutter frame into which the envelope holder for the Mackenzie-Wishart envelopes are fitted. The shutter is of the focal plane type, with adjustable slit, the distance being maintained by the usual cord and clip. An important feature of this shutter lies in the arrangement adopted to prevent the shutter being withdrawn until the blind is wound up. To effect this the shutter winding wheel is normally not in mesh. On pushing in the shutter of the envelope holder a peg jumps out of a cavity in the framework, and enters a depression in the shutter, which cannot now be withdrawn until the blind is fully wound. To effect this the winding wheel is pushed home and then engages the gear, the winding wheel is turned, and when the blind is fully wound up the peg holding the shutter of the plate holder falls out of the depression and the shutter can be withdrawn. The release of the shutter is made by means of a two-way thumb and finger lever conveniently placed at the right-hand side, the camera being held by means of adjustable straps or by brass handles. The camera is operated over the side of the machine, being held in the observer's hand. The camera is fitted with a cross-wire sight view-finder. The focal length of the lens is 8 in.

Object entry information: This camera, which is a development of the ""A"" type (see No. 106), was the first partially automatic plate-changing type, and was introduced early in 1916. In this type of camera the Mackenzie-Wishart holder has been removed and a frame is substituted. This frame is a repeating back with two openings, through one of which the exposure is made and through the other the exposed plate drops into a chamber. A magazine full of plates is placed in position over the shutter and a second empty magazine is fixed on the under side of the frame to receive the exposed plates. In this camera the process of plate-changing and setting the shutter is performed in one operation as in the later model ""L"" type (see No. 111).

Object entry information: This was the first type of metal aerial camera; it was in use during the early part of the war (1914–1918). This camera, which is provided with two magazines for the plates, may be fixed at some distance from the observer, who is able to expose the plate by means of a Bowden wire release. Cords attached to the plate-changing system enable him to change the plate, and also re-wind the focal plane shutter from the same position. No view-finder is fitted to this camera, but a separate sight may be used. A flap is fitted which prevents the plate being exposed when the slit of the shutter repasses it in re-winding. The size of plate is 5 in. by 4 in.

Object entry information: The general principles of this semi-automatic plate-changer type are similar to those now almost universally adopted for aerial plate photography. The process of changing the plate and setting the focal plane shutter is one operation, which may be accomplished either by hand, or automatically, by the action of wind on an air vane. This camera is provided with two magazines, each capable of holding 18 plates, the loaded one being placed in position in runners provided on top of the camera and the empty magazine beneath an extension. A hand lever on the side operates the plate changer and at the same time sets the focal plane shutter, while the knob, when pressed and released, exposes the plate. For automatic changing motive power is provided by a small air propeller, while the lever of the small auxiliary apparatus exposes the plate and releases the shutter, the time required to change the plate being about 10 seconds for an air speed of 50 miles per hour. The camera may also be operated at a distance by a single Bowden wire. The usual type of focal plane shutter is employed, with a sliding saddle to adjust the width of the opening. The blind is arranged as close as possible to the plate, being about ·1875 in. from it. A Ross 8·5-in. Xpress Lens is fitted.

A wire connection is made with the operating trigger, so that instead of firing the gun it exposes the film. The blind shutter is wound by means of a small lever, which also sets the shutter. A graticule, divided into small squares, can be adjusted to the gun sights. The camera is adapted to take roll films 2·25 in. wide.

Maker/Donor: The Williamson Kinematograph Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1920
Object entry information: The general principles of this semi-automatic plate-changer type are similar to those now almost universally adopted for aerial plate photography. The process of changing the plate and setting the focal plane shutter is one operation, which may be accomplished either by hand, or automatically, by the action of wind on an air vane. This camera is provided with two magazines, each capable of holding 18 plates, the loaded one being placed in position in runners provided on top of the camera and the empty magazine beneath an extension. A hand lever on the side operates the plate changer and at the same time sets the focal plane shutter, while the knob, when pressed and released, exposes the plate. For automatic changing motive power is provided by a small air propeller, while the lever of the small auxiliary apparatus exposes the plate and releases the shutter, the time required to change the plate being about 10 seconds for an air speed of 50 miles per hour. The camera may also be operated at a distance by a single Bowden wire. The usual type of focal plane shutter is employed, with a sliding saddle to adjust the width of the opening. The blind is arranged as close as possible to the plate, being about ·1875 in. from it. A Ross 8·5-in. Xpress Lens is fitted.

In the case of struts with blunt tails, such as are found in ""De Havilland"" (direct and reversed), ""Blériot,"" and ""Baby"" (reversed), a mass of dead water, i.e., of a region of low pressure, and therefore of high resistance, is indicated behind the strut.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The National Physical Laboratory.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: These photographs, which illustrate the flow of water round obstacles and aerofoils, were taken when investigating the direction and velocity of flow in a fluid medium. The cloudy material is produced by coating the object with condensed milk, whilst the more clearly defined short lines in some of the photographs are produced by illuminated drops of oil. In a time-exposed photograph the image of an illuminated particle will trace a line on the plate and the length of this line is a measure of the velocity of the particle during the exposure. The photographs marked A and B show these lines, and it will be seen that in the ""dead water"" regions the lines are very short, indicating that the velocity there is low. The flow of water is very slow, being only about 1 in. per second. A special wind channel of 6 in. square section was constructed and the relationship between air and water experiments compared. The two photographs of a balloon model indicate the similarity of flow in the two media. (See ""Technical Report of the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,"" 1911-12.)

Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: These photographs were taken in a horizontal current of air, having a velocity of about 30 ft. per second. The path followed by the air in travelling past an aeroplane or other body is marked by a jet of smoke issuing from one or more nozzles at the same velocity as the air. This smoke forms a horizontal band or bands if no obstruction is in its path. The smoke is formed by blowing air through two jars, one containing strong hydrochloric acid and the other strong ammonium hydrate. The air flows from left to right in all the photographs.

Object name: AEROPLANE STRUTS.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The National Physical Laboratory.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: The eleven struts shown were tested for air resistance in order to find the best form of section for use on aeroplanes. The tests were carried out in a 4-ft. wind channel with an air speed of 28 ft. per second. Some of the struts are copies of those in use on actual flying machines, whilst others are deduced from experiments on dirigible balloon models. The relative merits are expressed in terms of extra weight carried, and the difference between good and bad struts in a biplane may be equivalent to the carrying of an extra passenger. The accompanying reproductions of photographs taken at the National Physical Laboratory illustrate the flow of water round some of the struts. Short portions of the struts were cut off and fixed in a small water channel with glass sides. The flow of water round the struts was then indicated by the introduction of colouring matter into the stream. In the case of struts with blunt tails, such as are found in ""De Havilland"" (direct and reversed), ""Blériot,"" and ""Baby"" (reversed), a mass of dead water, i.e., of a region of low pressure, and therefore of high resistance, is indicated behind the strut. The table exhibited near by gives the results of the tests. (See ""Technical Report of the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,"" 1911-12.)

These specimens were again tested to destruction, and from these tests and the single specimen which broke in the gun-metal portion during the first test, the average tensile strength of the gun-metal was found to be 20 tons per sq. in.

The two tubes are connected to a water gauge, and the difference between the two pressures thus obtained is a direct measure of the velocity of the air. The velocity nozzle shown was made at the Royal Aircraft Factory, is known as a “R.A.F. tube,” and was designed to secure magnified readings on the manometer, which constitutes an air-speed meter. The static pressure tube is, in this example, enclosed by a cone that forms a “dead water” region, and in which there is a negative pressure.

It consists of two tubes placed in the air current so that the open end of one of them faces the stream and determines the dynamic pressure, while the other measures the pressure of the free air in the neighbourhood, i.e., the static pressure. The two tubes are connected to a water gauge, and the difference between the two pressures thus obtained is a direct measure of the velocity of the air. The velocity nozzle shown was made at the Royal Aircraft Factory, is known as a “R.A.F. tube,” and was designed to secure magnified readings on the manometer, which constitutes an air-speed meter. The static pressure tube is, in this example, enclosed by a cone that forms a “dead water” region, and in which there is a negative pressure.

Object entry information: This is the first tautness meter designed by Lieut.-Colonel O'Gorman and used early in 1910 for measuring the tension to which a wire was subject when in use in flight. The principle upon which the instrument is designed is that if a wire under tension is deflected from the straight the force tending to straighten it is a measure of the tension and the stiffness of the wire. The effect of the latter is eliminated by calibrating the instrument on a wire of the same stiffness. (See “Proc. Inst. Aut. Engineers,” 1911.)

Object entry information: The object of doping the fabric of an aeroplane or airship is to render it air and water-proof, to give it a smooth surface, and to tighten it. It is essential that a dope should dry quickly and be flexible when dry, in order that it may not crack or scale, and so permit moisture to enter. It should be proof against extremes of heat and cold, and be unaffected by oil or petrol.
Two specimen bottles of dope are shown, and 15 bottles containing the various ingredients from which it is made. The framed chart indicates the stages in the manufacture of cellulose acetate, a powder which, when dissolved in acetone or other appropriate solvent, is suitable for dope. Three specimens of doped fabrics are also shown.
The main basis of ordinary dope is cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate. The former is soluble in acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl formate, &c., and the latter in amyl, butyl, or ethyl acetates, but on account of the danger from fire it is not now used in Service aircraft.
The temperature found most suitable for doping is about 70 degrees F., and after three coats have been applied, the fabric is covered with a waterproof varnish.

Object entry information: by the fact that no light and efficient power unit existed, and it was not until the internal combustion engine had become more efficient that designers turned their attention seriously to airship construction. Dirigibles are of three types—non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid. The earliest examples were of the non-rigid type, being merely elongated balloons. The semi-rigid type usually had a spar situated longitudinally in the gas-bag, to which it was attached in such a manner as to distribute the load equally. The rigid type has been most successful, and the majority of airships now built are designed on this principle. The typical rigid construction consists of an aluminium alloy framework, or skeleton, of cylindrical form with obtuse cones fore and aft. It is often a 16-sided prism, the framework consisting of a series of polygon rings, trussed from stem to stem and kept severally expanded by steel wires, which, leading from each angle of the polygon, converge on a central ring. The lifting factor is hydrogen gas, enclosed in separate cells within the framework. The separate-cell system was originated by Zeppelin (see No. 134), who realised that, in such a design, the destruction of one of the gas-bags would not necessarily involve the collapse of the whole airship. A typical example of a rigid dirigible may be seen in the model of the Zeppelin airship ""Sachsen"" (see No. 136). The first lighter-than-air machine to achieve the trans-Atlantic flight was the airship R.34, a model of which is exhibited (see No. 139).

In the balloon represented the structure is divided into 18 compartments, each containing a balloon, and it is stated that several of these balloons may be pierced without seriously impairing the buoyancy of the airship. Immediately beneath the body of the airship is the enclosed keel, swelled out at its centre to form a cabin for the accommodation of passengers. The two cars are suspended one at each end of the keel and close to it. These are in communication with the central cabin by a passage inside the keel. Four propellers are fitted, and are supported on a structure of steel tubes sloping outwards and downwards from the sides of the hull. They are driven through bevel gearing by motors placed in the front and rear cars respectively. At the rear of the airship are the tail planes, consisting of a series of vertical and horizontal movable surfaces, hinged to form rudders and elevators respectively. Another series of fixed surfaces or fins act as stabilising planes.
In a recent airship of this type built for the German Navy it is stated that there are four motors of the six-cylinder Maybach type, each of 200 h.p., two being placed in each car. These give the airship a speed of 60 miles per hour at 800 revolutions per minute, the speed of the propellers being reduced to 450 revolutions per minute by chain gearing.

The harness fitted is of the “Guardian Angel ” (Calthrop) type. The supporting surface of this parachute is made of fine quality black silk, formed in the section of a sphere. This section has a diameter, when measured on the ground, of 28 ft., but it is contracted to 21 ft. when carrying a load in the air. There is a vent hole at the apex, having a diameter of about eight inches. Compressed air escapes through this hole in a vertical stream, and acts as a universal rudder. Beneath the parachute the air is compressed in the form of an inverted cone, the pressure increasing upwards to the parachute body. The maximum air pressure is within the body and as it escapes over the edge of the periphery. The rigging consists of 48 lines, which run from the fabric a distance of about 5 ft. From this point 24 lines are employed; they run direct to a wooden ring, 14 in. diameter. The harness is connected to this ring by a length of rope and is easily removable. The “Guardian Angel” harness, patented in 1914 by Mr. E. R. Calthrop, consists of two oval aluminium arm-pieces connected to a web belt. The parachute is attached directly to these arm-pieces and to the belt. The parachutist’s body is supported by the arm-pieces, the belt, and by a strap which passes between the legs. A quick re’ease mechanism is fitted to guard against the danger of being dragged along the ground after alighting. When the lever is moved to the vertical the three parts of the fastening are unlocked and the harness may be instantly removed. In the locked position the lever is kept stationary by means of the leather slide. When the parachute is withdrawn from the case it opens in two to three seconds, the momentum is absorbed, and the parachutist adopts the average rate of fall, which is, approximately, 16 ft. per second, or 10.9 miles per hour. All this takes place in a vertical fall of about 100 ft. There is practically no free fall, and no shock is experienced.

Object entry information: The supporting surface of this parachute is made of fine quality black silk, formed in the section of a sphere. This section has a diameter, when measured on the ground, of 28 ft., but it is contracted to 21 ft. when carrying a load in the air. There is a vent hole at the apex, having a diameter of about eight inches. Compressed air escapes through this hole in a vertical stream, and acts as a universal rudder. Beneath the parachute the air is compressed in the form of an inverted cone, the pressure increasing upwards to the parachute body. The maximum air pressure is within the body and as it escapes over the edge of the periphery. The rigging consists of 48 lines, which run from the fabric a distance of about 5 ft. From this point 24 lines are employed; they run direct to a wooden ring, 14 in. diameter. The harness is connected to this ring by a length of rope and is easily removable. The “Guardian Angel” harness, patented in 1914 by Mr. E. R. Calthrop, consists of two oval aluminium arm-pieces connected to a web belt. The parachute is attached directly to these arm-pieces and to the belt. The parachutist’s body is supported by the arm-pieces, the belt, and by a strap which passes between the legs. A quick re’ease mechanism is fitted to guard against the danger of being dragged along the ground after alighting. When the lever is moved to the vertical the three parts of the fastening are unlocked and the harness may be instantly removed. In the locked position the lever is kept stationary by means of the leather slide. When the parachute is withdrawn from the case it opens in two to three seconds, the momentum is absorbed, and the parachutist adopts the average rate of fall, which is, approximately, 16 ft. per second, or 10.9 miles per hour. All this takes place in a vertical fall of about 100 ft. There is practically no free fall, and no shock is experienced. The impact on landing is equivalent to that of a jump from a height of four feet.

Object entry information: This rigid airship was built by Messrs. Beardmore for H.M. Government during the latter part of the war (1914–1918). It was the first lighter-than-air craft to achieve a direct Trans-Atlantic flight, the journey being made from East Fortune, Scotland, to Mineola, Long Island, U.S.A. The airship was wrecked in 1921 as the result of an accident following a cruise over the North Sea. H.M. Airships R.33 and R.34 represented a type based on the design of the German super-Zeppelin L.33, launched in 1916. The two British vessels were nearly identical in design and were constructed simultaneously. It was found on completion that R.34 was in some respects superior and having an increased lift was capable of carrying a greater quantity of fuel; for this reason she was selected to make a Transatlantic crossing. The rigid structure, or framework, in this airship consists of a number of polygons built up of individual duralumin girders spaced ten metres apart longitudinally and joined from corner to corner by other lattice girders, the whole being braced with steel wire. The gasbags, or balloonets, nineteen in number, are enclosed between these transverse polygonal frames and are made of fine cotton proofed with a layer of rubber to which is attached a layer of gold-beater’s skin. Four cars are suspended from the hull structure. The forward [text cuts off].

Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: This single-seater tractor biplane (The British Experimental No. 12) was designed and manufactured at the Royal Aircraft Factory, South Farnborough, in 1916–1917, for general military purposes. It was subsequently produced by the Daimler Co., Ltd., for H.M. Government. This is the most recent biplane of the B.E. general type. It was used successfully in the destruction of Zeppelins and for other purposes during the war (1914–1918). The machine has all the essential features of the Royal Aircraft Factory design and is fitted with a 150 horse-power R.A.F. 4a engine. The pilot’s cockpit is situated slightly in rear of the main planes, which are cut away in order to provide a clear view. No armament is shown in the model, but various devices for attack were fitted to the biplane according to the purpose for which it was intended. For night flying, illumination was provided at the wing tips to facilitate landing and for airship destruction a bomb launching apparatus was arranged between the pilot’s legs. A machine gun was also fitted. The principal data are : Span of main planes, 37 ft. ; overall length, 27·3 ft. ; chord, 5·6 ft. ; stagger, 2 ft.

Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: This two-engined tractor biplane was produced in 1917 for H.M. Government by the Aircraft Manufacturing Co., Ltd., London, the chief designer being Capt. Geoffery de Havilland. It was primarily intended for bombing by day at high speed and it was used successfully for that purpose during the latter part of the war (1914–1918). The machine was also produced in bulk by the Daimler Co., Ltd. The De Havilland No. 10 was a development of the two-engined pusher biplane (D.H.3) made by the same firm. The two power units are placed between the planes, being overhung from one side of the outer centre section struts. The fuselage is situated beneath the lower plane and provides accommodation for two gunners in addition to the pilot. Each gunner is provided with a machine gun on a ring mounting. The machine is fitted with dual control, the second control being operated by the gunner in rear. The slides for the stowage of bombs.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed at the Benson Observatory by Mr. W. H. Dines, F.R.S., to record heights attained by aircraft against time. It consists of an aneroid barometer, calibrated to conform with a height scale on a moving chart. Specimens of actual records obtained with this type of instrument are shown adjacent.
The instrument has two pairs of flexible vacuum boxes mounted opposite one another in a metal framework. Two leaf springs convey the motion from the vacuum boxes, as they expand during ascent, to a central mechanism which is supported between them and is provided with an arm carrying a pen-pointer. Coil springs serve to return the central mechanism as the vacuum boxes contract during descent. The chart (M.O. Form 4270) is inserted between rollers, which are rotated by a clock mechanism, and is graduated for height up to 25,000 feet, and for time in periods of 10 minutes up to 6.5 hours. Altitude records can thus be made for flights up to 6.5 hours duration without changing the chart.
The instrument is inexpensive to make and is easily carried. Another type of altigraph for use on aircraft is exhibited adjacent (see No. 88b). For application of the aneroid principle in the design of altimeters see Nos. 89 and 90.

Object entry information: This automatic camera is designed to take a series of photographs at regular intervals. It was originally intended for general service in the field and for photographing long trench systems; it was also used in 1915 in the Middle East for map making purposes.
A roll film four inches wide is used with a maximum capacity of 75 feet (180 pictures), the size of each photograph being 4·875 by 3·5 inches. The film is carried forward by an interlocked claw and punch movement which ensures that the film is held stationery while exposures are being made. The exposure is made by a focal plane shutter with adjustable aperture and tension. A separate velvet covered metal flap shutter, actuated by the driving mechanism and correctly timed with the focal plane shutter, obscures the light during the shutter winding stroke. The film is wound on spools which engage with the driving mechanism. The ""take-off"" spool is retarded by an adjustable slipping clutch and the re-wind spool is driven by a similar clutch geared from the claw movement. The film is thus held at the correct tension

A patent centrifugal cut-out governor mounted on the airscrew limits the speed at which the film is driven. This speed is controlled by a hand lever which in its lowest position entirely disconnects the drive. The speeds are approximately 0 to 5 exposures per minute. A handle is provided for assisting in threading up the film. An inverted aneroid is mounted above the camera on a short tripod. It has double glass faces suspended between which is a compass needle. The aneroid dial is illuminated by light reflected from the circular base of the tripod which is painted white for this purpose. A photograph is made of the aneroid dial through a lens of 0.75 in. focus provided with a self-capping sector shutter which is worked simultaneously with the focal plane shutter. An image is thus produced through the back of the film, in the corner of the main picture, showing approximately the height at which the picture was made and giving the north point. The aneroid is graduated from 0 to 10,000 feet (marked reversely on the dial to counteract the fact that it is photographed through the back of the film) and can be set to zero by hand.

The whole is imbedded in paraffin wax enclosed in a wooden box having an ebonite top through which the terminals are brought out. The capacity of the condenser, is 0.0025 microfarads. The spark gap consists of two ribbed aluminium electrodes, one of which is adjustable regarding its distance from the other by means of an ebonite handle projecting from the side of the instrument. An insulated locking ring is provided for setting up the spark gap after adjustment. Ventilation is allowed for by a gauze window. The primary induction consists of 11.75 turns of tinned copper strip, supported by four ebonite battens. The wave lengths obtained by attaching the central lead to various points on the inductance are marked on the battens. The valve of the inductance is 19.0 microhoms. A flat spiral inductance, behind the strip inductance, is inserted in the primary circuit when the switch mounted at the corner of the instrument is put to “long.” This makes the instrument ready for operating on the long waves which are engraved in red on one of the battens.

A flat spiral inductance, behind the strip inductance, is inserted in the primary circuit when the switch mounted at the corner of the instrument is put to “long.” This makes the instrument ready for operating on the long waves which are engraved in red on one of the battens.

uiug.30112069175039-seq_80.jpg,114b ,"AIRCRAFT RECEIVER, MODEL T.F.",Lent by The Air Ministry.,1919,"This receiver was designed for use by H.M. aerial forces during the war (1914–1918). The instrument is intended for the reception of both spark and continuous wave signals and may be used in aircraft either for wireless telegraphy or telephony. For the principle on which this instrument is based see wireless apparatus, collection of electrical engineering. The receiver is a combined tuner, detector and amplifier. It is capable of receiving spark signals on the wave length ranges of 150–350 metres and 500–700 metres. In addition it can receive both spark and continuous wave signals on the range of 1,000–2,500 metres. Three hard vacuum valves of the French pattern are employed. The first acts as a detector and high-frequency amplifier, while the second and third amplify audio-frequencies only. A filament rheostat is situated in the middle of the terminal panel. It consists of a helix of manganin wire of 1·2 ohms resistance. A detector valve grid condenser of 1·6 jars capacity, with mica dielectric, is connected to the grid of the first valve and is shunted by a carbon rod resistance. The carbon rod resistance is of the Remco type and of approximately 2 megohms. The multiple-segment wave length switch has three positions, one for each of the three ranges of wave-length. It makes all the necessary connections in each case, with the exception of the parallel condenser which has a separate adjust-ment. The timing variometer has inside and outside coils wound with 7/36 S.W.G. copper wire. The inductance of each coil when alone is approximately 290 microhms; when connected in series as a variometer the range is from 140 to 1,060 microhms. The variometer is graduated in degrees only, calibration cards being supplied for the various aerial capacities. The terminals of the instrument are arranged so that it may be used conveniently on a closed aerial coil for direction finding. The parallel condensers are four in number. They have copper foil conductors and mica dielectric clamped together between ebonite plates. Their capacities are marked above the switch. Two telephone jacks are fitted, one being in the anode circuit of the first valve and the other in the anode circuit of the third valve. The batteries required are one of 6 volts and one of 100 volts. They are connected to the plug sockets which are marked appropriately.",Inv. 1919-536.,"Continuation from previous page: [TRUE]

Object entry information: This instrument (No. 472) is designed for ground station use in connection with the Aircraft Tuner, Mark 3 (see Inv. 1919–534) for the magnification of signals. It is suitable for high or low frequency and employs three valves. For principle on which this instrument is based see wireless apparatus, collection of electrical engineering. A diagram of connections is shown on the lid of the box containing the instrument. The terminals A and B, on the left, are connected to the tuner; those on the right are connected to a H.T. battery of 100–150 volts and to a L.T. battery of 4 volts and are marked appropriately. Low resistance telephones are connected to the terminals beneath the filament current switch. When it is desired to operate, the filament current is switched on and adjusted to obtain the best results. In the above method the first valve is used as a rectifier. If it is desired to use a crystal for rectifying, the connections are made in the same way except that the terminals A. and B. of the amplifier are connected to the telephone terminals of the tuner and the terminals C. and D. (behind the valves on the ebonite board) are short circuited.
