The instrument consists of a permanent horse-shoe magnet, having short coils mounted upon its poles, while in front of the coils is a thin iron disc or diaphragm carried by a block of wood, through which there is a hole communicating with an external mouth or ear-piece. The coils are joined in series, and connected by a line wire with those of a similar instrument, the circuit being completed by connecting one terminal at each end with the earth. Speech uttered into the mouth-piece of one of the instruments sets the diaphragm into a state of vibration, and its movements produce variations of the number of lines of magnetic force passing through the coils. Alternating currents, corresponding to the pitch, amplitude and timbre of the sound, are consequently induced, and are transmitted to the second instrument. On passing through the coils of the latter, these currents, by producing changes in the magnetisation, cause variations of the force with which the diaphragm is attracted. This is consequently made to repeat the movements of the first diaphragm, and the original sounds are reproduced. Each instrument is used alternately as a transmitting and as a receiver to reproduce the sounds. In modern telephony distinct instruments are employed for transmitting and receiving. The receivers generally used are similar in principle to those shown, but considerably modified in design; modern transmitters, however, are altogether different, phenomena of loose-contact being employed to impress audio-frequency modulations on the current from a battery.""], ""other"": [""Plate 8""]}","{""object_names"": [""Early Bell telephone instrument"", ""telecommunications telephone"", ""telephone""], ""makers"": [""Unknown maker""], ""organisations/institutions"": [""Lloyds station""], ""dates"": [""1877""], ""places"": [""United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""The mouth/ear piece is not original and was added by the museum in 1906""], ""other"": [""1877"", ""Bell, Alexander Graham""]}"

Means must be provided whereby a subscriber on any automatic exchange may connect himself with any subscriber on his own or any other exchange, and the connection must be made in such a manner as to make the most economical use of lines and automatic switches. Moreover, during the period of transition which must elapse before the whole system has been converted to automatic working, special apparatus must be provided to deal with calls between the existing manual exchanges and the new automatic exchanges. After a prolonged study of the problem, the British Post Office Authorities have decided that the system to be installed in the London Area shall be based on the well-known Step-by-Step system, with the addition of the important \u201cDirector\u201d principle. The function of the Director is to receive and store the subscriber\u2019s call in its original form, and to proceed to send it out into the exchange switching mechanism, translated into any trains of impulses which may be required by the existing lay-out of junction routes and switching centres. Having steered the call through, link by link, to the line of the required subscriber, the director disconnects itself from the line and becomes available for other calls. Another important feature of the system is the Coder Call Indicator. This switchboard is the connecting link between a subscriber on an automatic exchange and a subscriber served from a manual exchange. It is a fine example of engineering skill, permitting impulses received from the automatic subscriber to be translated by the Director to be reproduced in the manual exchange in the form of an illuminated display of the required number. For traffic in the opposite direction various methods may be adopted, one of which\u2014the use of cordless \u201cB\u201d positions\u2014is included in this exhibit."", ""The model, which was originally constructed for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, is probably for its size the most complex mechanism extant."", ""Six exchange switching centres are represented, access to these being given by a number of automatic telephones included in the exhibit."", ""During the hours when the model is shown in operation, visitors may make test calls with these instruments, and may trace their progress through the various units and observe the manner in which calls from one automatic exchange to another, or between a manual and an automatic exchange, are dealt with."", ""Step-by-Step system"", ""Director principle"", ""Coder Call Indicator""], ""other"": [""Inv. 1925-913""]}","{""object_names"": [], ""makers"": [], ""organisations/institutions"": [""Science Museum Group""], ""dates"": [], ""places"": [], ""descriptions"": [""Working model of an automatic telephone system.
