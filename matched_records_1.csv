Maker/Donor: Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: 1816
Object entry information: This is a specimen of the conductor, together with a model of the dial used by Sir Francis Ronalds on the experimental electric telegraph circuit in the garden of his house in the Upper Mall, Hammersmith, in 1816. He employed a frictional electric machine (see Cat. No. 3) to charge the line, and at each end had a pith-ball electroscope which collapsed when the line was discharged. At the two stations were dials revolved synchronously by clockwork; the dials were marked with the alphabet, but were masked by front plates that left only one letter visible. The sender discharged the line when he saw the desired letter, and the receiver noted the letter at which the pith-balls collapsed. By the use of a code, a word or even a whole sentence could be conveyed by two or three discharges. Ronalds made his first experiments through eight miles of overhead wire suspended by silk from hooks in horizontal bars. He then laid down his underground line :— “A trench was dug in the garden 525 ft. in length and 4 ft. deep ; in this was laid a trough of wood 2 in. sq., lining the inside of it with pitch, and in this trough tubes were placed through which the wires ran. The joints between the glass tubes were made with soft wax. The trough was then covered with pieces of wood screwed down upon it while the pitch was hot ; these also were well covered with pitch and the earth then thrown into the trench again.” Some of this line was dug up in 1862. The invention was brought to the notice of the Admiralty, but it was then deemed “wholly unnecessary,” and Ronalds seems to have gone no further with it. (20868)

Object entry information: This is a copy of a portion of the telegraph, preserved in the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Petrograd, which was the outcome of experiments made by Baron P. L. Schilling in 1825–32. The receiver part of the instrument consists of a galvanometer with a horizontal needle suspended by a silken thread. The needle carries above it a disc of paper painted black on one side and white on the other; by the deflection of the needle to right or left, two primary signals were obtained. The instrument was made almost "" dead beat "" by a plate on the axis dipping into a bath of mercury beneath. The alarm call shown consists of a horizontal needle suspended in a coil and so arranged that when deflected by the passage of a current it strikes a trigger gear that releases the escapement of a clockwork alarm. The currents were first transmitted by placing the ends of the line wires in a bath of mercury, but afterwards a simple key was added.

Object entry information: These are relics of the electric telegraph devised by Prof. S. B. Morse and constructed by him in 1835. The transmitter consisted of a clockwork mechanism by means of which cast metal type, some of which are shown, were fed past a lever. The serrations on the edges of the type actuated the lever and thereby caused it to make intermittent contact in a pair of mercury cups. In the receiver an electro-magnetic arrangement caused a pen to make irregular V-shaped marks on a paper strip which was drawn past it by clockwork. These marks were interpreted as numbers which were arranged in a code-book. A model of the apparatus was worked through ten miles of insulated wire, wound upon two reels, in the year 1837.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Institution of Electrical Engineers.
Date of creation: February, 1837
Object entry information: The alarum is set in motion by means of an electro-magnet. The armature on being actuated removes a detent and allows the clockwork to ring the bell. Finding that the alarum would not work reliably, through even one mile of wire, Sir W. F. Cooke consulted Sir Charles Wheatstone with a view to finding a remedy. This resulted in the invention of the Wheatstone relay, a delicate instrument, which by responding to feeble currents, closes a local battery circuit through the coils of the alarum electro-magnet, and permits of signalling over great distances. Developments of the relay are in use in nearly all modern telegraph systems. The first meeting of Wheatstone and Cooke took place in February, 1837, and led to the establishment of the partnership which extended over many years and proved so productive of new ideas in the progress of the electric telegraph.

Object entry information: This is a copy of a portion of the telegraph, preserved in the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Petrograd, which was the outcome of experiments made by Baron P. L. Schilling in 1825–32. The receiver part of the instrument consists of a galvanometer with a horizontal needle suspended by a silken thread. The needle carries above it a disc of paper painted black on one side and white on the other; by the deflection of the needle to right or left, two primary signals were obtained. The instrument was made almost "" dead beat "" by a plate on the axis dipping into a bath of mercury beneath. The alarm call shown consists of a horizontal needle suspended in a coil and so arranged that when deflected by the passage of a current it strikes a trigger gear that releases the escapement of a clockwork alarm. The currents were first transmitted by placing the ends of the line wires in a bath of mercury, but afterwards a simple key was added.

Object entry information: These are relics of the electric telegraph devised by Prof. S. B. Morse and constructed by him in 1835. The transmitter consisted of a clockwork mechanism by means of which cast metal type, some of which are shown, were fed past a lever. The serrations on the edges of the type actuated the lever and thereby caused it to make intermittent contact in a pair of mercury cups. In the receiver an electro-magnetic arrangement caused a pen to make irregular V-shaped marks on a paper strip which was drawn past it by clockwork. These marks were interpreted as numbers which were arranged in a code-book. A model of the apparatus was worked through ten miles of insulated wire, wound upon two reels, in the year 1837.

Object entry information: This instrument was included in 1837 by Messrs. Cooke & Wheatstone in their first patent for improvements in giving signals by electric currents; a single-needle telegraph was, however, already known. Five galvanometers or magnetic needles and coils were used, arranged in a horizontal row on the vertical diamond-shaped dial; stops were placed to limit the deflection of the needles. Each needle was operated by a separate lever fitted with two finger keys, so arranged that a current could be sent in either direction. When signalling two needles were simultaneously deflected in opposite directions, the letter was indicated by the intersection of their centre lines on the dial and the point of intersection of their centre lines on the dial indicated the letter to be read off. Twenty letters could thus be signalled, and by employing the needles singly the ten numerals could be transmitted; these numerals were placed on the margins of the lower half of the dial. To obtain a closed circuit when the needles were used singly, a sixth lever and line wire were provided. The letters C, J, Q, U, X, and Z were not represented on the dial, other letters or combinations of letters being used instead. Plate 2.

Object entry information: This system, which requires no battery for its operation, was patented in 1848 by Messrs. W. F. Henley & T. Forster. It was used in this country by the Magnetic Telegraph Company. When one of the two pedal keys is depressed, an electro-magnet is partially rotated in close proximity to the poles of a powerful compound permanent magnet. This movement generates a momentary magneto-electric current which passes to line and operates the corresponding needle at both the sending and receiving stations. On releasing the key, it is restored to its former position by a strong spring, and by this reversed movement, another momentary current is transmitted, this time in a contrary direction. On the axis of each indicating needle, and parallel to it is a small permanent magnet which swings between the poles of a semicircular electro-magnet. The pulsation of current received from line causes the electro-magnet to deflect

Date of creation: 1848 (patented).
Object entry information: This system, which requires no battery for its operation, was patented in 1848 by Messrs. W. F. Henley & T. Forster. It was used in this country by the Magnetic Telegraph Company. When one of the two pedal keys is depressed, an electro-magnet is partially rotated in close proximity to the poles of a powerful compound permanent magnet. This movement generates a momentary magneto-electric current which passes to line and operates the corresponding needle at both the sending and receiving stations. On releasing the key, it is restored to its former position by a strong spring, and by this reversed movement, another momentary current is transmitted, this time in a contrary direction. On the axis of each indicating needle, and parallel to it is a small permanent magnet which swings between the poles of a semicircular electro-magnet. The pulsation of current received from line causes the electro-magnet to deflect

Object entry information: This instrument was used about 1853 by the Electric Telegraph Co. It supplanted Bain's chemical recorder, as it obviated the troublesome chemical preparation of the paper, but reading the embossed marks was found so fatiguing, that this instrument was in turn displaced by the ink-writer. A relay or local circuit is used to work the electro-magnet, whose armature is fitted to a horizontal lever, working between stops at one end and carrying a steel style at the other. When the armature is attracted downwards, the style is pressed upwards against a strip of paper drawn from a large reel by two friction rollers, set in motion by a train of clockwork. In the upper roller is a narrow groove into which the style presses the paper and, according to the time the armature is held down, embosses a dot or a dash.

Object entry information: This instrument was adopted by the British Post Office in 1874, but had previously been in use in America. It consists of an electro-magnet having a soft iron armature mounted on a lever which moves between stops. The armature is attracted on the passage of the current, in opposition to the pull of a spring, and each signal consists of two clicks, one as the armature descends when attracted and the other when it returns under the action of the spring, the interval between the two depending upon whether the signal is a dot or a dash.

The dial has symbols corresponding with the instrument with which it works. The pointer is fixed on a small escape-wheel of 15 teeth which is propelled by a hair-spring; the levers are attached to two small magnets fixed to an arbor vibrating between the pole pieces of two small electro-magnets. A button above the dial serves to adjust the pointer by hand, and in the lower part of the case is placed an alarm.

It supplanted Bain's chemical recorder, as it obviated the troublesome chemical preparation of the paper, but reading the embossed marks was found so fatiguing, that this instrument was in turn displaced by the ink-writer. A relay or local circuit is used to work the electro-magnet, whose armature is fitted to a horizontal lever, working between stops at one end and carrying a steel style at the other. When the armature is attracted downwards, the style is pressed upwards against a strip of paper drawn from a large reel by two friction rollers, set in motion by a train of clockwork. In the upper roller is a narrow groove into which the style presses the paper and, according to the time the armature is held down, embosses a dot or a dash.

Maker/Donor: Made and presented by Messrs. Siemens Bros. & Co.

Object entry information: This compact telegraph set enables the sender to take a carbon copy of the transmitted message from the signals actually sent. The style is a single current Morse key and when held as a pencil, with the white stud uppermost, pressure of the point on the paper closes a circuit connecting the battery to line. In practice, therefore, the message is written and signalled at the same time in Morse code. When not in use for sending, the style joins the line to one end of an electro-magnet coil, the other end of which is connected to earth. The coil works on a pivoted arm and is lightly held against a limiting stop by a spiral spring. When a current passes through the windings, the coil turns downward on its pivots and the metal ends of the core strike on an iron plate, thus giving the characteristic click of a sounder. A small compass needle, supported near the coil, acts as a galvanometer by electro-magnetic induction.

Object entry information: This instrument, which was invented by Major A. C. Fuller, R.E., was extensively used during the war of 1914–18. Under ideal conditions, the apparatus is so sensitive that it will operate with a current of less than half a micro-ampere. On field lines, where heavy leakage is frequently experienced, the system is superior to other methods of line telegraphy. It possesses the outstanding advantage that the weak direct current traversing the circuit does not produce noticeable inductive effects in adjacent wires and it is almost impossible for a Fullerphone circuit to be “tapped.” At the receiving station the signals are passed through an interrupter which renders them suitable for reception on a telephone receiver. The Fullerphone may also be superposed on telephone circuits so that both telegraph and telephone services work simultaneously without the one interfering with the other.

It possesses the outstanding advantage that the weak direct current traversing the circuit does not produce noticeable inductive effects in adjacent wires and it is almost impossible for a Fullerphone circuit to be “tapped.” At the receiving station the signals are passed through an interrupter which renders them suitable for reception on a telephone receiver. The Fullerphone may also be superposed on telephone circuits so that both telegraph and telephone services work simultaneously without the one interfering with the other.

Object entry information: This instrument is designed to work either as a single needle or as a single current Morse sounder. By a sliding movement of the two brass studs on the front of the dial, the needle may be either centred between the split tubes, in which condition it is suitable for single needle working, or it may be adjusted to rest normally on the left-hand pin, in which case the needle acts as a sounder armature and responds to Morse signals sent from a single current key.

Maker/Donor: Made and presented by Messrs. Siemens Bros. & Co.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This compact telegraph set enables the sender to take a carbon copy of the transmitted message from the signals actually sent. The style is a single current Morse key and when held as a pencil, with the white stud uppermost, pressure of the point on the paper closes a circuit connecting the battery to line. In practice, therefore, the message is written and signalled at the same time in Morse code. When not in use for sending, the style joins the line to one end of an electro-magnet coil, the other end of which is connected to earth. The coil works on a pivoted arm and is lightly held against a limiting stop by a spiral spring. When a current passes through the windings, the coil turns downward on its pivots and the metal ends of the core strike on an iron plate, thus giving the characteristic click of a sounder. A small compass needle, supported near the coil, acts as a galvanometer by electro-magnetic induction.

The instruments shown are those by which the first messages through the submarine cable from Dover to Cape Gris Nez were transmitted, in 1851. The transmitter has 40 buttons or keys, but there are only 29 different symbols, as the commoner ones are repeated. The keys are in two straight lines and when depressed engage with pins disposed in a single helix on the surface of a cylinder, rotated by bevel friction wheels, controlled by a continuously running fly. Fixed to the end of the cylinder is a commutator pressing upon two straight lines in the line circuit by which intermittent currents are sent to line when the wheel is released, the cylinder starts revolving at its full speed. In the receiver is a type-wheel, with the same number of symbols in the same order as in the transmitter, rotated by spring-driven wheelwork. A flier arm on the axis of the type-wheel engages with a tooth on the armature lever of an electro-magnet attracted by the intermittent currents. The type-wheel is further controlled by a ratchet wheel, the pawl of which can only move slowly, being attached to a dash-pot. The paper tape is advanced by a separate train of wheels which also give motion, whenever the type-wheel stops, to a pad wheel. The paper tape is advanced by eccentrics which move the plate up to the type. Inking is done by a roller.

Object entry information: This instrument is designed for perforating the strip of paper or ""tape,"" used in automatic transmitters. The first puncher, by Sir C. Wheatstone (patent No. 1239, A.D. 1858) perforated the tape in two parallel lines representing the signals, while a central line of holes indicated the spaces between letters and words. The code used was a modification of Steinheil’s (1836), in which the number of holes in succession on either side of the central line was limited to four. In this instrument, patented by Sir C. Wheatstone in 1867, the tape is punched with a uniform line of central apertures, the signals as before being indicated by side perforations. There are three keys fixed to bell-crank levers, lifted by springs and each controlling a punch. The tape from a reel is drawn down a vertical groove by means of a small disc and lever worked from the central key-lever. The outside key-levers punch the side holes representing the symbols and by a projection on the centre key depressed it also. The latter is depressed independently for the spaces between letters and words.

The end of each key lever enters a circular ring provided with inclined notches; when a key is depressed it is kept down by the ring, but when a second key is touched that ring is slightly moved, so releasing the other key and locking the second one. Depressing a key also releases a wheel on a spring-driven train, which allows the pointer to travel round till stopped by the key lever; the axis of the pointer carries a commutator which sends to the line wire a reversed current for every letter that the pointer passes. In the receiver a type-wheel, on the axis of an escapement actuated by a spring-driven drum wound up by the printing mechanism, is controlled by spring-driven currents. Printing is performed by a spring-driven train liberated by an electro-magnet on a local battery circuit, closed by a vibratory arrangement which acts when the type-wheel stops.

Dujardin; the instrument was used by the Electric Telegraph Co. during 1865 on the line between London and Edinburgh. The receiver and transmitter are identical. There is a piano keyboard of 28 keys, each of which by a lever raises a pin in the periphery of a circular plate and catches an arm kept revolving by the treadle-wheel below. On the same shaft is a 14-wave face cam which causes a lever to vibrate between stops and sends reversals of the current to line to release the escapement of the type-wheel step by step. A polarised relay and local battery are used to work the wheelwork and prolong the action on the anchor at the extremity of any particular oscillation; this closes the local circuit of an electro-magnet which does the printing. An electro-magnetic device causes the printing currents to be equal in duration whether a key is held down for a long or a short interval of time. Inking is done by a pad.

Two line wires are used, one of which transmits a current proportional to the vertical and the other to the horizontal displacement of the transmitter’s pen from its central position. This is accomplished by having attached to this pen two jointed rods which transmit the two components of the motion to contact pieces that slide over resistance frames arranged at right angles. These frames are built up of insulated plates set on edge and connected by a wire of high resistance.
At the receiving end each wire circuit actuates its own needle, but the two needles are at right angles and provided with light springs by which they are connected with a single vertical capillary siphon or pen with its point in contact with a paper tape. The paper at both stations is drawn along continuously by clockwork contained in the bases of the instruments.

Maker/Donor: Presented by The Post Office.
Date of creation: 1882–4
Object entry information: A method of simultaneously sending a number of messages in either direction along one line wire, which necessitated synchronous movements of apparatus at the two stations, was suggested by Mr. B. Meyer in 1871 and was rendered practicable for Morse working by Mr. P. B. Delany in 1882–4.
The principle is indicated by a diagram in which A and B represent two stations connected by a line wire, and x, y are two arms, rotating at equal rates over the numbered segments which are insulated from one another. If each segment be connected with transmitting and receiving instruments any message transmitted from 1 will be received at 1', from 2 at 2', and so on.
A reed and wheel arrangement patented by Mr. P. la Cour in 1878 and invented, independently, by Lord Rayleigh, is employed to drive each arm at a rate of about three revolutions per sec. The reed is kept in a state of vibration by means of an electro-magnet, the movements of the reed itself producing the necessary makes and breaks of the circuit as in a trembling bell. Included in the circuit there is a second electro-magnet, which drives a phonic-wheel and is mounted on the axis of the rotating arm. The latter consequently moves at a rate determined by the vibrations of its reed. A fly-wheel mounted on the same axis, is made of wood containing mercury in two concentric grooves.
This arrangement does not, however, ensure absolute synchronism, and further provision is made by sending and receiving correction currents. When the arm at one station is over a sending-correction group, that at the other station is over a receiving-correction group.
The number of messages which can be sent simultaneously depends on the retardation of the line.
This system was, at one time, used in this country to a limited extent, hexode working being employed between London and Birmingham.
The apparatus exhibited consists of a distributor and a reed. To render the wheel visible, the distributor has been removed from the metal ring upon which it was mounted.

The latter consequently moves at a rate determined by the vibrations of its reed. A fly-wheel mounted on the same axis, is made of wood containing mercury in two concentric grooves.
This arrangement does not, however, ensure absolute synchronism, and further provision is made by sending and receiving correction currents. When the arm at one station is over a sending-correction group, that at the other station is over a receiving-correction group.
The number of messages which can be sent simultaneously depends on the retardation of the line.
This system was, at one time, used in this country to a limited extent, hexode working being employed between London and Birmingham.
The apparatus exhibited consists of a distributor and a reed. To render the wheel visible, the distributor has been removed from the metal ring upon which it was mounted.

Object name: BAUDOT DISTRIBUTOR PLATE.
Maker/Donor: Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a modern sending plate, of French pattern, designed for use on a Baudot quadruple telegraph set.
Revolving brushes of flexible metal sweep over the surfaces of the rings in pairs. For instance, the second ring, consisting of 24 segments, may be joined through a pair of brushes to the continuous ring number 5, which is connected to line. In this way each keyboard is in contact with the line for a fraction of a second at frequent intervals. A separate distributor plate, of slightly different construction, is required for receiving. All the brushes are, however, carried on a common spindle which passes through the central aperture of both plates.

Object name: WRITING TELEGRAPH.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. E. A. & C. E. Cowper.
Date of creation: 1878
Object entry information: The experimental transmitter and receiver are shown, together with specimens of the writing and a diagram of the general arrangement. The instruments were invented by Mr. E. A. Cowper in 1878, and have worked successfully through a resistance of 1,000 ohms.
Two line wires are used, one of which transmits a current proportional to the vertical and the other to the horizontal displacement of the transmitter’s pen from its central position. This is accomplished by having attached to this pen two jointed rods which transmit the two components of the motion to contact pieces that slide over resistance frames arranged at right angles. These frames are built up of insulated plates set on edge and connected by a wire of high resistance.
At the receiving end each wire circuit actuates its own needle, but the two needles are at right angles and provided with light springs by which they are connected with a single vertical capillary siphon or pen with its point in contact with a paper tape. The paper at both stations is drawn along continuously by clockwork contained in the bases of the instruments.

Object name: DELANY MULTIPLEX TELEGRAPH.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Post Office.
Date of creation: 1882–4
Object entry information: A method of simultaneously sending a number of messages in either direction along one line wire, which necessitated synchronous movements of apparatus at the two stations, was suggested by Mr. B. Meyer in 1871 and was rendered practicable for Morse working by Mr. P. B. Delany in 1882–4.
The principle is indicated by a diagram in which A and B represent two stations connected by a line wire, and x, y are two arms, rotating at equal rates over the numbered segments which are insulated from one another. If each segment be connected with transmitting and receiving instruments any message transmitted from 1 will be received at 1', from 2 at 2', and so on.
A reed and wheel arrangement patented by Mr. P. la Cour in 1878 and invented, independently, by Lord Rayleigh, is employed to drive each arm at a rate of about three revolutions per sec. The reed is kept in a state of vibration by means of an electro-magnet, the movements of the reed itself producing the necessary makes and breaks of the circuit as in a trembling bell. Included in the circuit there is a second electro-magnet, which drives a phonic-wheel and is mounted on the axis of the rotating arm. The latter consequently moves at a rate determined by the vibrations of its reed. A fly-wheel mounted on the same axis, is made of wood containing mercury in two concentric grooves.
This arrangement does not, however, ensure absolute synchronism, and further provision is made by sending and receiving correction currents. When the arm at one station is over a sending-correction group, that at the other station is over a receiving-correction group.
The number of messages which can be sent simultaneously depends on the retardation of the line.

Date of creation: 1895–1905
Object entry information: In this telegraphic typewriter, which was patented by Mr. L. Kamm in 1895–1905, the printing is done in page form at both ends of the line by similar instruments, the operator at the transmitting end simply using a keyboard as in an ordinary typewriter. Two currents are sent over the line for each signal transmitted, the interval of time between the two depending upon the letter signalled. Mounted on a vertical axis, which carries a sector bearing the type, there is an arm, termed a “ synchronising arm,” which is normally retained in its zero position by a catch. When a key is depressed, this arm is released and a spring pin connected with the key lever is raised. At the same time, a current is sent over the line, which causes the arm at the receiving end also to be released. The arms receive motion from adjustable springs, and the arm at the transmitting station moves until arrested by the raised pin, contact with which sends a second current to line and brings the distant arm also to be brought to rest. This is effected by means of a piece on the underside of the arm, which, under the action of an electro-magnet, is made to project, and, as the arm moves at equal rates, to catch against the pin corresponding with the one raised at the sending station. A local circuit at each end is closed, which energises an electro-magnet and causes the type letter corresponding to the position of the arm to be printed on the paper. The arms are then returned to their initial positions by the action of other electro-magnets. For rotating the paper roller and returning the carriage to its initial position when commencing a new line, a separate electro-magnet is provided, the exciting circuit for which is closed when the arm moves over all the pins to its extreme position, a special key with no connected pin being provided for this purpose.

Object name: FORBES TYPE-BAR TRANSLATOR.
Maker/Donor: Made and Presented by A. Forbes, Esq.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This remarkable type-printing telegraph is of the sliding type-bar class, but each bar has the whole alphabet on its printing face. The apparatus was constructed by the inventor, a schoolmaster by profession, purely as an experimental model, and has never been developed. Nevertheless, it worked perfectly at over 200 words per minute with type fixed by means of seccotine to type-bars made from umbrella ribs. The type-bars are supported between two toothed discs gearing with pinions on a motor shaft, which slowly revolves. Between the discs is a drum, which is stationary, and has a series of sloping grooves terminated by cam surfaces. Each type-bar has five setting pins friction-tight in the bar and arranged to be set by five magnets. The positioning of a type-bar depends upon the setting of its pins, which are spaced apart at distances, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 units, each unit being equal to the width of a single type. The bars are adjusted to the printing position by means of the setting pins engaging as the bar rotates with sliding grooves. In this way the required letter is at the printing point after the bar has travelled 180° from the setting point. The setting of the bar is therefore a very leisurely process, and in this respect alone the printer is unique. Each pin, after passing through a groove, is reset by a sloping cam surface on the stationary drum, while each type-bar has a small lug on its underside, which comes in contact with a sloping reset plate after passing the printing point. The working model is provided with a transmitting mechanism, which actuates the setting magnets by means of perforated tape. This tape had at first two rows of holes for advancing the paper, but one row was subsequently found more satisfactory. It was shown adjacent to the five-unit perforator shown adjacent to the instrument. (See H. Harrison, ""Printing Telegraph Systems and Mechanisms."")

Between the discs is a drum, which is stationary, and has a series of sloping grooves terminated by cam surfaces. Each type-bar has five setting pins friction-tight in the bar and arranged to be set by five magnets. The positioning of a type-bar depends upon the setting of its pins, which are spaced apart at distances, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 units, each unit being equal to the width of a single type. The bars are adjusted to the printing position by means of the setting pins engaging as the bar rotates with sliding grooves. In this way the required letter is at the printing point after the bar has travelled 180° from the setting point. The setting of the bar is therefore a very leisurely process, and in this respect alone the printer is unique. Each pin, after passing through a groove, is reset by a sloping cam surface on the stationary drum, while each type-bar has a small lug on its underside, which comes in contact with a sloping reset plate after passing the printing point. The working model is provided with a transmitting mechanism, which actuates the setting magnets by means of perforated tape. This tape had at first two rows of holes for advancing the paper, but one row was subsequently found more satisfactory.

Object name: PRELIMINARY AND FIRST COMPLETE MODELS OF THE MURRAY AUTOMATIC PRINTING TELEGRAPH.
Maker/Donor: Made and Presented by Donald Murray, Esq.
Date of creation: 1896 (Preliminary wooden model made)
Object entry information: In machine telegraphy an operator transmits messages by playing on a keyboard, and the whole of the rest of the work is done by machinery, the chief mechanism being the telegraph printer at the receiving station. The central principle in all such machines is that of the key and lock. There is a separate key and a separate lock for each letter. The keys are assembled in the transmitting keyboard, and the locks, which are at the receiving station, form a “selector” which operates the typewriter. In modern telegraph printers the permutation lever lock is used combined with what is known as the five-unit alphabet. As about 32 of these permutation lever locks are required for letters and operation signals, they are arranged in a circle or in a straight line. The circular form was the first to come into practical use in the type-writing telegraphs, culminating in the Baudot Multiplex in 1875. The straight-line plan was old, but was first put into practical form by Mr. Donald Murray in Sydney, Australia, in 1898, in the models which are here exhibited. The preliminary wooden model, which was made in 1896, shows the essential features of all subsequent machines of the straight-line class, including the Murray automatic printer adjacent to it. This printer was taken to New York in 1901, and was developed with the assistance of the Postal Telegraph Co. into the Murray automatic printing telegraph system. This was brought to London in 1901, and after further improvement was used by the British, German, Russian and other administrations. The Murray automatic system was combined with the Baudot multiplex by Murray, with the assistance of the British Post Office, between the years 1907 and 1912, the result being the Murray multiplex (a combined Automatic-Multiplex system). From this has developed the Western Union Multiplex, the Western Electric Multiplex and the Morkrum multiplex. All these American printing telegraphs, several thousands of which are now in use, embody the same permutation lever lock principle shown in the wooden model accompanying this description.

The received slip may either be used for retransmission, or be passed through a Creed printer, which types the message in ordinary characters. At an intermediate transmitting office, it was formerly necessary to transcribe messages from the Morse tape and to re-perforate the signals by hand, if required for transmission over another Wheatstone circuit. By the Creed system, the perforated tape is automatically prepared by the received signals at high speed. A relay, fixed to the baseboard, carries a light arm, which moves from side to side according to the direction of the incoming current. At the end of the arm is an arrangement for opening and closing a small valve which controls the supply of compressed air—at about 30 lb. per sq. in.—to pistons. The direction of movement of the pistons determines whether a marking or a spacing hole shall be performed through the paper slip. In order to avoid tearing the paper, a mechanical contrivance arrests the movement of the paper feed wheel for about 1/300th of a second while the punch is perforating and being withdrawn from the tape. A later pattern of Creed receiving perforator, which works without air pressure, was introduced in 1921.

Object entry information: The perforated tape, containing a batch of three or four messages, having been prepared, the next step is automatic transmission, that is to say, collection of the space signals and transmission as time signals. There are two well-known methods of accomplishing this. The first is the direct method, in which metallic brushes make electrical contact through the holes of the paper tape. In the second, or indirect, method, the signals are transmitted by the intervention of a number of small levers and rods controlled by the tape. This method, which is similar in principle to the Jacquard loom, was first used in the Wheatstone automatic transmitter, and experience has shown it to be the best. It is used in the present case.
The name of the instrument is derived from the fact that the slip perforations are in a single row. The transmitter automatically sends out a train of five currents impulse of a time, corresponding to one letter or character, with distinct pauses between each train.
With regard to any one train, if there is no current perforation in the corresponding five centre hole length of slip, the five current impulses are all negative, actually forming one continuous negative current. If, however, one or more perforations occur, the corresponding current impulses to line are positive in direction and the remainder of the five are negative.
A diagram placed beside the instrument shows the alphabet employed and (Figs. 2 and 3) the resulting currents to line produced by the passage of slip perforated with the word ""and.""

By this means one particular group of slots in the combs, and only one out of 56, is brought into alignment so that a cross-bar can drop into it and cause a letter to print. From the point of view of the theory of machines, the combs form a complicated series of 56 permutation locks. The 56 cross-bars are the bolts or latches, and the universal bar which is really a universal key. The locks are continually being closed in different ways by the tape, and the universal key is continually opening the locks. This intricate system of keys and locks is inevitable in all cases where complex control is needed. Amongst other instances it is used in systems of railroad interlocking gear, and although there is no outward resemblance between the Murray and the Baudot telegraph systems, the principle of the permutation locks is the same in both cases, and indeed in all high-speed printing telegraph systems.",Inv. 1924-154.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

Object name: KEYBOARD PERFORATOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The messages for transmission are first punched in tape by means of this perforator, which translates the Roman letter-space signals of the written message into the five letters of the five-unit telegraph alphabet. The perforator includes a typewriter keyboard and a punch-block with five punches and an electro-magnetic, the armature of which feeds the tape forward one letter space on its back stroke. On the right may be seen the lever for pulling the tape back letter by letter when a correction is necessary. The correction is made by striking the letter-shift key (caps), which punches five holes in a letter space, and so blots out all other permutations which have been previously punched. At the other end of the line this signal leaves the printer unaffected, its function being to shift the action of the printer from figures to letters. The signal may be repeated half a dozen times so as to blot out a whole word, and there will be no trace of the error in the printed message.

Object name: SINGLE-LINE TRANSMITTER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The Institution of Electrical Engineers.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The perforated tape, containing a batch of three or four messages, having been prepared, the next step is automatic transmission, that is to say, collection of the space signals and transmission as time signals. There are two well-known methods of accomplishing this. The first is the direct method, in which metallic brushes make electrical contact through the holes of the paper tape. In the second, or indirect, method, the signals are transmitted by the intervention of a number of small levers and rods controlled by the tape. This method, which is similar in principle to the Jacquard loom, was first used in the Wheatstone automatic transmitter, and experience has shown it to be the best. It is used in the present case.
The name of the instrument is derived from the fact that the slip perforations are in a single row. The transmitter automatically sends out a train of five currents impulse of a time, corresponding to one letter or character, with distinct pauses between each train.
With regard to any one train, if there is no current perforation in the corresponding five centre hole length of slip, the five current impulses are all negative, actually forming one continuous negative current. If, however, one or more perforations occur, the corresponding current impulses to line are positive in direction and the remainder of the five are negative.
A diagram placed beside the instrument shows the alphabet employed and (Figs. 2 and 3) the resulting currents to line produced by the passage of slip perforated with the word ""and.""
For a detailed description of the mechanism of the transmitter, see Crotch’s “Telegraphic Systems,” 1908, or the inventor’s description in the I.E.E. Journal for February, 1905.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: At the receiving station, the signals operate a polarised relay, in the local circuit of which is connected an electro-magnetic perforator. This consists essentially of a punching and a spacing magnet operated through contacts closed alternately by a vibrating reed. The speed of the latter is governed by a relay, so that it is kept in unison with the reed of a phonic-wheel which is incorporated in the transmitter. The receiving perforator produces a facsimile of the transmitting tape, which is then available for retransmission or for printing.

Object entry information: If the tape is not required for retransmission, the tape signals have to be translated into Roman signals and printed. The essential features of the Murray printer have been described in the label which accompanied the original models.
The tape is fed along letter by letter (five units at a time) by a star-wheel carried on a shuttle, which is kept reciprocating by means of a cam. Each reciprocation rotates the star-wheel one letter space. The shuttle carries a die-plate coinciding with the circumference of the star-wheel and having five holes corresponding with the message holes in the tape.

Object entry information: This apparatus was recently invented by S. R. Smith, Esq., and is designed to store up a number of signals in readiness for transmission over a circuit where the sending instrument operates at definite time intervals. In such cases, the telegraphist, working with a storage transmitter, has to observe the pauses, but if he works the key-board direct to line, has to observe any desired speed, the symbols being stored and transmitted in turn. The depression of a key lever causes metal pins to project from one of a series of radial lines of holes in a disc, the projections being in accordance with the symbol selected. The disc is constantly revolving, and each line of pins is in turn brought into connection with contact springs controlling a relay which sends the selected currents to line. After performing this function, the pins are restored to normal in readiness for further selection.

The instrument here shown, which is due to Messrs. Taylor, Dearlove and Brown, is a special form of curb sender for correctly retransmitting the signals received on a relay, and was patented by Mr. S. G. Brown, F.R.S., in 1899. The relay mentioned was designed to overcome the difficulty of securing sufficiently good electrical contact under the slight pressure obtainable from an instrument actuated by weak arrival currents at the end of a long cable. The point of a contact arm (representing the siphon in the ordinary form of recorder) was caused to traverse the cylindrical surface of a rapidly rotating drum. This surface was divided into two parallel halves by a short insulating space on which the arm normally rested, so that two separate conducting surfaces were provided, with either of which the arm would make contact in its excursions from the central position.
The special form of curb sender here shown is designed to secure the correct retransmission of any given number of consecutive elements of a letter which are of the same sign, but which signals are received at the end of a long cable; the relay arm will not return to its zero position between consecutive elements of the same sign, but will remain on the respective contact surface during the whole time occupied by such consecutive elements.
The instrument consists of two cams, the form of which regulates the component of the curb-fed signal, one cam being for the dot element and the other for the dash. These cams, by means of clutches controlled by the relay, are mechanically rotated by clockwork, the speed of rotation being approximately adjusted to the rate of transmission of a single element; so that the requisite number of consecutive elements is transmitted, corresponding to the duration of contact of the relay arm with the side controlling that particular element.
By a modification of the apparatus the message, instead of being immediately retransmitted, can be punched on a slip which can be inserted in an automatic transmitter.

Thus the coil makes a small angular movement either to right or left, and a contact-making pointer to which it is harnessed is deflected on to one or other of two silver discs and thereby closes the local circuit of the dot or dash retransmitting relay. A feature of this instrument is the method of eliminating friction between the pointer and the adjacent silver contacts by rotating the latter at a moderate speed through the medium of a small electric motor. Without this device the minute forces of the signal currents would not suffice to move the pointer. (See also Cat. No. 68, Dipper Relay.)",Inv. 1925-189.,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object entry information: The relay mentioned was designed to overcome the difficulty of securing sufficiently good electrical contact under the slight pressure obtainable from an instrument actuated by weak arrival currents at the end of a long cable. The point of a contact arm (representing the siphon in the ordinary form of recorder) was caused to traverse the cylindrical surface of a rapidly rotating drum. This surface was divided into two parallel halves by a short insulating space on which the arm normally rested, so that two separate conducting surfaces were provided, with either of which the arm would make contact in its excursions from the central position.
The special form of curb sender here shown is designed to secure the correct retransmission of any given number of consecutive elements of a letter which are of the same sign, but which signals are received at the end of a long cable; the relay arm will not return to its zero position between consecutive elements of the same sign, but will remain on the respective contact surface during the whole time occupied by such consecutive elements.
The instrument consists of two cams, the form of which regulates the component of the curb-fed signal, one cam being for the dot element and the other for the dash. These cams, by means of clutches controlled by the relay, are mechanically rotated by clockwork, the speed of rotation being approximately adjusted to the rate of transmission of a single element; so that the requisite number of consecutive elements is transmitted, corresponding to the duration of contact of the relay arm with the side controlling that particular element.
By a modification of the apparatus the message, instead of being immediately retransmitted, can be punched on a slip which can be inserted in an automatic transmitter.

Object entry information: This relay, designed by S. G. Brown, Esq., F.R.S., receives signals attenuated after transmission through a long submarine cable, and restores them to their original strength before retransmission through a second cable. The signal currents pass through a coil delicately suspended in a strong magnetic field. The automatic transmitter (i.e. a battery reverser operated by perforated tape) at the distant end of the cable causes the received currents to traverse the coil in one direction for a Morse dot and in the opposite direction for a Morse dot.

It produces the telegraph tape at a far higher speed than either the signal key perforator or the ordinary “two-hand” perforator by reason of the fact that the perforation of a letter is completed by a single depression of the appropriate lever, whereas in other instruments each body physical movement on the part of the operator, e.g. a letter H in the Morse code, involving four distinct impulses on the ordinary perforator, is completed in a single impulse on the keyboard perforator.

Object name: SIGNAL KEY PERFORATOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Eastern Associated Telegraph Companies.
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This instrument was designed in 1902 to prepare the perforated tape used in the automatic transmission of telegrams. The feature of this instrument is that the perforating mechanism is controlled by the same type of hand key as is used for direct hand transmission and with which, therefore, all cable operators are familiar. As the manipulation of the hand key calls for less exertion than is the case with the ordinary two-hand operated perforator, the instrument is specially suitable for use at tropical stations.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is an instrument designed to receive signals attenuated after transmission through a long submarine cable and to restore them to their original strength before retransmission through a second cable. The signal currents pass through a coil delicately suspended in a magnetic field. The coil makes a small angular movement in one direction for a dash and in the opposite direction for a Morse dot. At the same time, one or other of two fine platinum wire electrodes to which the coil is harnessed dip into an acid bath and thus complete a local circuit through the “dot” or “dash” retransmitting relays.

Object name: SIGNAL KEY PERFORATOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Eastern Associated Telegraph Companies.
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This instrument was designed in 1902 to prepare the perforated tape used in the automatic transmission of telegrams. The feature of this instrument is that the perforating mechanism is controlled by the same type of hand key as is used for direct hand transmission and with which, therefore, all cable operators are familiar. As the manipulation of the hand key calls for less exertion than is the case with the ordinary two-hand operated perforator, the instrument is specially suitable for use at tropical stations.

Maker/Donor: Presented by The Eastern Associated Telegraph Companies.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is an instrument designed to receive signals attenuated after transmission through a long submarine cable and to restore them to their original strength before retransmission through a second cable. The signal currents pass through a coil delicately suspended in a magnetic field. The coil makes a small angular movement in one direction for a dash and in the opposite direction for a Morse dot. At the same time, one or other of two fine platinum wire electrodes to which the coil is harnessed dip into an acid bath and thus complete a local circuit through the “dot” or “dash” retransmitting relays.

Object name: THE 1924 ATLANTIC CABLE. Telescopic Specimen.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co.
Date of creation: 1924
Object entry information: This is a portion of the submarine cable laid between New York and the Azores for the Western Union Telegraph Co. It is continuously loaded with a new magnetic alloy, developed by the Western Electric Co., which strengthens the magnetic field 2,000 times. It represents the first radical change in submarine cable construction for more than 50 years. In contrast to the other electrical industries, the development of submarine cables has been slow and conservative, owing to the great expense involved in any large-scale experiments. In 1887 the late Oliver Heaviside investigated the problems raised by the large capacity of long cables, and showed how the effects could be counteracted by the insertion of loading coils. In 1899 the suggestion was taken up by Pupin, who gave practical details for this method, but it was not until 1906 that the first Pupinised underwater cable was laid, in Lake Constance. In 1902 it was proposed by Krarup for loading the cable continuously by wrapping an iron wire round the copper conductor, but the losses in ordinary iron were found to offset the gains, so that the method was never extensively used, while it was found impossible to surmount the mechanical difficulties of jointing, &c., for the use of Pupin coils in deep-sea cables. The discovery of “Permalloy,” a heat-treated nickel-iron alloy having a permeability 2,000 as great as ordinary iron, has made it possible to revert to continuous loading. The alloy is made in the form of tape, 6/100ths in. thick, and is wound immediately over the copper core. An experimental length of 120 miles of cable loaded in this manner was submerged to a depth of 2½ miles at Bermuda on the 13th October, 1923, and this having proved entirely satisfactory, the full 2,300 miles necessary for an Atlantic cable were manufactured forthwith.

Object name: THE 1924 ATLANTIC CABLE. Telescopic Specimen.
Maker/Donor: Presented by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co.
Date of creation: 1924
Object entry information: This is a portion of the submarine cable laid between New York and the Azores for the Western Union Telegraph Co. It is continuously loaded with a new magnetic alloy, developed by the Western Electric Co., which strengthens the magnetic field 2,000 times. It represents the first radical change in submarine cable construction for more than 50 years. In contrast to the other electrical industries, the development of submarine cables has been slow and conservative, owing to the great expense involved in any large-scale experiments. In 1887 the late Oliver Heaviside investigated the problems raised by the large capacity of long cables, and showed how the effects could be counteracted by the insertion of loading coils. In 1899 the suggestion was taken up by Pupin, who gave practical details for this method, but it was not until 1906 that the first Pupinised underwater cable was laid, in Lake Constance. In 1902 it was proposed by Krarup for loading the cable continuously by wrapping an iron wire round the copper conductor, but the losses in ordinary iron were found to offset the gains, so that the method was never extensively used, while it was found impossible to surmount the mechanical difficulties of jointing, &c., for the use of Pupin coils in deep-sea cables. The discovery of “Permalloy,” a heat-treated nickel-iron alloy having a permeability 2,000 as great as ordinary iron, has made it possible to revert to continuous loading. The alloy is made in the form of tape, 6/100ths in. thick, and is wound immediately over the copper core. An experimental length of 120 miles of cable loaded in this manner was submerged to a depth of 2½ miles at Bermuda on the 13th October, 1923, and this having proved entirely satisfactory, the full 2,300 miles necessary for an Atlantic cable were manufactured forthwith.

Maker/Donor: Lent by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: 1847
Object entry information: Arresters are designed to carry away the great rush of current that results from a lightning flash near a line, and so prevent injury to the operators or the instruments. The charge in a line from lightning is of such potential that it will leap air gaps or other resistances that are quite impassable to the battery current, and it is upon this difference that the action of most arresters relies. The vacuum arrester was invented by Mr. C. F. Varley in 1847, although not patented till 1861, and is for the protection of an underground line connected with an overhead one. From the line, wire is led to platinum terminals fixed into a glass globe, in which is also a wire connected to the earth. The line terminals end in points close to the earth wire, and by exhausting the air from the globe the resistance of the gap is so reduced as to leave a ready path for high-tension electricity. (a) This form of arrester was brought out by Mr. Varley about 1856, and is designed for protecting six line wires. It consists of six metal points, each one connected to a line wire, and fixed radially in close proximity to a ring connected to earth; the whole is covered with a glass bell-jar (missing), under which probably contained a chemical that absorbed the gas in the bell, and the other mercury, which acted as a barometer column. (b) This is a smaller and modern form of the vacuum arrester (a), and is intended for a single line.

The gaps are adjustable and decrease toward the terminals to which the instruments are connected, the last gap being small and made between two fine platinum points. The self-induction of the coils does not interfere with the ordinary current through the circuit, but chokes back a discharge of any magnitude, and forces it to escape through the air gaps. The major portion of a lightning discharge passes across the first gap while the remainder is filtered through the other gaps.

Object entry information: These are brass plate lightning arresters of types still used, in which the opposing flat surfaces are separated by sheets of mica. Holes in the latter form air gaps, across which the lightning discharge passes. Three examples are shown: one has rectangular plates and a mica sheet with two rectangular holes, while the other two have circular plates with mica discs perforated by three circular holes. One of these latter examples consists of three plates separated by two mica discs, the middle plate being connected with earth, and the upper and lower plates with the up and down lines respectively. In each case the screws which hold the plates together are insulated from the top plates by an insulating bush. One of the examples has been sectioned.

Date of creation: 1889
Object entry information: This arrester for protecting telephone and telegraphic instruments, &c., was patented by Sir Oliver Lodge in 1889, and made by Messrs. Muirhead & Co. There are five spark gaps made by two series of rods, the rods of each series being connected together by self-induction coils. The gaps are adjustable and decrease toward the terminals to which the instruments are connected, the last gap being small and made between two fine platinum points. The self-induction of the coils does not interfere with the ordinary current through the circuit, but chokes back a discharge of any magnitude, and forces it to escape through the air gaps. The major portion of a lightning discharge passes across the first gap while the remainder is filtered through the other gaps.

Object entry information: This form of magnetic telephone, patented by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, was one of the earliest to be brought into practical use. The instrument consists of a permanent horse-shoe magnet, having short coils mounted upon its poles, while in front of the coils is a thin iron disc or diaphragm carried by a block of wood, through which there is a hole communicating with an external mouth or ear-piece. The coils are joined in series, and connected by a line wire with those of a similar instrument, the circuit being completed by connecting one terminal at each end with the earth. Speech uttered into the mouth-piece of one of the instruments sets the diaphragm into a state of vibration, and its movements produce variations of the number of lines of magnetic force passing through the coils. Alternating currents, corresponding to the pitch, amplitude and timbre of the sound, are consequently induced, and are transmitted to the second instrument. On passing through the coils of the latter, these currents, by producing changes in the magnetisation, cause variations of the force with which the diaphragm is attracted. This is consequently made to repeat the movements of the first diaphragm, and the original sounds are reproduced. Each instrument is used alternately as a transmitting and as a receiver to reproduce the sounds. In modern telephony distinct instruments are employed for transmitting and receiving. The receivers generally used are similar in principle to those shown, but considerably modified in design; modern transmitters, however, are altogether different, phenomena of loose-contact being employed to impress audio-frequency modulations on the current from a battery.

Object entry information: (3) This microphone is similar to the foregoing example, except that it is mounted in a small wooden box enclosed in a larger box, apparently to act as a kind of sounding board.
(4) A carbon rod microphone with sharpened ends resting in carbon cups on a wooden base.
(5) A tubular microphone, containing granulated substance forming multiple contacts.
(6) A glass bottle, containing a steel needle hanging in light contact within a small hole in a carbon block. This last was probably one of those used by Prof. Hughes as a detector of what are now known as Hertzian or wireless signals.
A further selection of early microphones is described below.

Object name: EARLY MICROPHONES AND EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS.
Maker/Donor: Made by Prof. D. E. Hughes. Presented by the Executors of the late Mrs. Anna C. Hughes.
Date of creation: 1878 and 1879
Object entry information: This is a further selection of the original apparatus made and used by Prof. Hughes in the experiments which led him from the discovery of the microphone in 1878 to the transmission and reception of wireless signals over a short distance in 1879.
A number of microphones designed and made by Prof. Hughes in 1878 and 1879 are exhibited:
(1) Carbon pencil microphones, invented by Prof. Hughes in 1878; each consists of a pencil of carbon supported with its ends in hollows in two small carbon blocks. Several examples of this type of microphone are exhibited with a number of pencils of various sizes and shapes.
(2) Microphones in which the pressure on the contacts is regulated by means of a spring. In two of the examples shown the spring acts through a pivoted lever, the contacts being, in one case, between three small blocks of pinewood charcoal and in the other between a piece of coke and a steel rod. In the third example, the contacts are between carbon pellets contained on a glass tube and acted on directly by a helical spring.
(3) Microphone consisting of two weighted carbon rods suspended by paper strips so that they lie horizontally, each in contact with two vertical carbon rods. There are thus four contacts in series. The microphone is mounted on a pinewood diaphragm.
(4) Granular microphones in which a very large number of contacts are obtained by passing the current through a tube containing a granulated substance. The substances most often used by Prof. Hughes were zinc and silver filings. Three examples are shown, the granules being contained in a quill, a glass tube and a hollow bamboo. This type of microphone was developed by Prof. Hughes without knowledge of the previous work of Edison.
Several types of microphones were used for detecting wireless signals. (See “Electrical Communication,” Part II, Cat. No. 1.)

Maker/Donor: Patented by Mr. H. Hunnings; Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: 1878
Object entry information: The granular transmitter was patented by Mr. H. Hunnings in 1878, and was afterwards considerably modified.
The modified form shown consists of a carbon diaphragm and a carbon plate, the central portion of the intervening space being occupied with carbon granules. Its action depends on the varying electrical resistance, due to the varying pressure, produced by the sound vibrations. The whole is mounted in a porcelain frame provided with a mouth-piece.

In the example shown six tongues are suspended by tapes from a cross-member. At their lower ends strips of carbon are attached, and these press lightly on small carbon blocks, cylindrical in shape, which are placed at right angles to the strips. Each strip makes electrical contact with two adjacent carbon blocks, and alternate blocks throughout the length of the transmitter are connected with a brass which carries a terminal strip.
The arrangement is such that there are 12 variable contacts, arranged two in series in six parallel circuits. The mechanism is mounted on a board hinged at the top so that its inclination to the vertical, and consequently the pressure of the contacts upon each other, may be adjusted.

Object entry information: This transmitter, which is very similar to that employed in the telephone set shown under Cat. No. 124, was patented by Mr. Campbell Swinton in 1884 and 1885.
Fourteen carbon rods are strung on a wire stretched across a light bent wire frame, and at their lower ends rest against a stout carbon rod placed across the framework and insulated from it. There are thus 14 variable resistance contacts placed in parallel circuits. The frame is supported on a larger frame by four rubber bands, the object of which is to prevent other vibrations than those of the speaker's voice from affecting the microphone.
No diaphragm is used, the vibrations of the voice acting directly upon the carbon rods.

PXL_20251126_132534640.jpg,114.,TELEPHONE SET.,Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.,,"This is one of the first subscribers' sets supplied by the Edison Telephone Co., which commenced operations in this country in 1879. The main features of the instrument, the carbon transmitter and electromotograph (see adjacent exhibit), were patented by Edison in 1877. The transmitter, used—the parent of all modern transmitters—consists essentially of a button of soft carbon, about 3/8 in. in diameter, placed between two brass discs. One of these discs has a small glass centre, against which presses a brass stud fixed to the sheet iron diaphragm. The two brass discs are connected with the terminals of the instrument. Speech into the mouth-piece causes the diaphragm to vibrate, and produces variations in the resistance of the button and corresponding variations in the current transmitted through the line. The receiver, or “electromotograph,” has a small chalk cylinder, which is kept moistened with potassium iodide, and which is rotated by a handle through worm gearing. A brass diaphragm carries at its centre a brass strip spring, holding a platinum contact piece, which presses lightly against the chalk cylinder, the spring being tangential to the cylinder. The amount of friction exerted on the platinum contact by the rotating cylinder varies with the current passing to it from the sender, and this causes the spring and diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrations are damped by an indiarubber pad, the pressure of which against the back of the spring may be adjusted by a screw. This receiver, although loud and clear, required too much attention, and was abandoned after the amalgamation of the Edison and Bell Companies in 1880. Within the box, on which the transmitter is fitted, is an induction coil with three windings, and the mechanism seen above the box is a relay for the bell. There are also two keys, one for ringing and the other for closing the local microphone circuit. When the ringing key is up, the relay and the “tertiary” of the induction coil are connected in series between line and earth. Depressing the relay key breaks this connection and substitutes the battery between the line and earth. The microphone circuit is made up of the microphone, two cells of the battery, microphone key and primary of the induction coil. The tertiary coil acts as secondary for transmission and primary for receiving.",Inv. 1915-229.,"Continuation from previous page: FALSE

One of these discs has a small glass centre, against which presses a brass stud fixed to the sheet iron diaphragm. The two brass discs are connected with the terminals of the instrument. Speech into the mouth-piece causes the diaphragm to vibrate, and produces variations in the resistance of the button and corresponding variations in the current transmitted through the line. The receiver, or “electromotograph,” has a small chalk cylinder, which is kept moistened with potassium iodide, and which is rotated by a handle through worm gearing. A brass diaphragm carries at its centre a brass strip spring, holding a platinum contact piece, which presses lightly against the chalk cylinder, the spring being tangential to the cylinder. The amount of friction exerted on the platinum contact by the rotating cylinder varies with the current passing to it from the sender, and this causes the spring and diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrations are damped by an indiarubber pad, the pressure of which against the back of the spring may be adjusted by a screw. This receiver, although loud and clear, required too much attention, and was abandoned after the amalgamation of the Edison and Bell Companies in 1880. Within the box, on which the transmitter is fitted, is an induction coil with three windings, and the mechanism seen above the box is a relay for the bell. There are also two keys, one for ringing and the other for closing the local microphone circuit. When the ringing key is up, the relay and the “tertiary” of the induction coil are connected in series between line and earth. Depressing the relay key breaks this connection and substitutes the battery between the line and earth. The microphone circuit is made up of the microphone, two cells of the battery, microphone key and primary of the induction coil. The tertiary coil acts as secondary for transmission and primary for receiving.

Object entry information: This is a wall instrument of an early type, with Blake transmitter and a trembler bell. No receiver is shown fitted. The transmitter was patented by Mr. F. Blake in 1879, and was the subject of an action between the Edison and the Bell Telephone Companies, the former of which claimed that the instrument infringed their patent (see telephone set, Cat. No. 114). In 1880 the two companies amalgamated and became the United Telephone Co., and the action was withdrawn. A sheet-iron diaphragm is used, against which presses a platinum contact mounted on a light flexible spring. The other end of this platinum contact presses lightly against a carbon button supported on another flexible spring. The springs are insulated from one another, and both mounted on a lever pivoted at the top and able to swing towards or away from the diaphragm. The pressures of the contacts are regulated by a screw which engages a slanting surface on the lower end of this lever. This telephone set, in common with most of the earlier instruments, was at first used in conjunction with one-line wire only, the return circuit being through the earth. The instrument has a switch operated by the receiver.

Object entry information: Owing to the very small electric currents developed in the magnetic telephone as arranged by Graham Bell (Inv. 1906–10), it could be used efficiently as a transmitter over comparatively short distances only. Transmitters were consequently introduced in which currents from batteries were utilised, and the acoustical effects were employed to produce variations of the resistances of the circuits. Undulating currents were thus obtained, which, by means of magnetic receivers, were made to reproduce the exciting sounds. At first the transmitter and its battery were placed in circuit with the line wire and the distant receiver, and as the variations in resistance produced in the transmitter were small compared with the total resistance, the changes in the current were correspondingly small. This difficulty was overcome by using an induction coil, the primary of which was in circuit with the transmitter and battery, while the secondary was connected with the line. T. A. Edison in 1877 constructed an instrument of this type, the action of which depended upon changes in the resistance of carbon with variations of pressure, while, in 1878, Prof. D. E. Hughes introduced his ""microphone"" (Cat. Nos. 100 and 101), which utilised the variation of the resistance of substances in loose contact placed in the neighbourhood of the sounds to be reproduced. Carbon was found to be the most suitable material, and many forms of carbon transmitters embodying the principle of Hughes's apparatus are now employed. The instruments shown are of a type which was used in the British Post Office, in which a carbon transmitter, patented by Mr. F. A. Gower in 1880, is employed. This consists of eight carbon pencils, supported between eight carbon blocks and one central block, all the blocks being recessed to receive loosely the reduced ends of the pencils. Four of the outside blocks are connected by means of a copper strip with one terminal of the battery, while the remaining four are connected, through the primary of an induction coil, with the other. The blocks are mounted upon a thin deal board, which constitutes the diaphragm and is enclosed in a wooden casing fitted with a porcelain mouth-piece.

Each subscriber's line was joined to a separate vertical strip through an indicator (not shown), and any two lines were connected by the insertion of two pegs, so as to place the two vertical strips in contact with the same horizontal strip. The twenty-fifth vertical bar was assigned to the exchange operator's telephone set.

Object entry information: Owing to the very small electric currents developed in the magnetic telephone as arranged by Graham Bell (Inv. 1906–10), it could be used efficiently as a transmitter over comparatively short distances only. Transmitters were consequently introduced in which currents from batteries were utilised, and the acoustical effects were employed to produce variations of the resistances of the circuits. Undulating currents were thus obtained, which, by means of magnetic receivers, were made to reproduce the exciting sounds. At first the transmitter and its battery were placed in circuit with the line wire and the distant receiver, and as the variations in resistance produced in the transmitter were small compared with the total resistance, the changes in the current were correspondingly small. This difficulty was overcome by using an induction coil, the primary of which was in circuit with the transmitter and battery, while the secondary was connected with the line. T. A. Edison in 1877 constructed an instrument of this type, the action of which depended upon changes in the resistance of carbon with variations of pressure, while, in 1878, Prof. D. E. Hughes introduced his ""microphone"" (Cat. Nos. 100 and 101), which utilised the variation of the resistance of substances in loose contact placed in the neighbourhood of the sounds to be reproduced. Carbon was found to be the most suitable material, and many forms of carbon transmitters embodying the principle of Hughes's apparatus are now employed. The instruments shown are of a type which was used in the British Post Office, in which a carbon transmitter, patented by Mr. F. A. Gower in 1880, is employed. This consists of eight carbon pencils, supported between eight carbon blocks and one central block, all the blocks being recessed to receive loosely the reduced ends of the pencils. Four of the outside blocks are connected by means of a copper strip with one terminal of the battery, while the remaining four are connected, through the primary of an induction coil, with the other. The blocks are mounted upon a thin deal board, which constitutes the diaphragm and is enclosed in a wooden casing fitted with a porcelain mouth-piece.

Two carbon pencils are used, the reduced ends of which enter large-sized holes in two rectangular carbon blocks, which are fixed to the diaphragm. Between the pencils, and pivoted in the two carbon blocks, is a bridge which carries on its lower side a flat brush of stiff bristles which bears against the pencils, so that their ends are always in contact with the surface of the holes in the carbon blocks. The brush also prevents independent rolling motion of the pencils, which is one of the probable causes of a jarring noise being heard in the receiver when a carbon pencil microphone is used in a vertical position. The lever with which the receiver (not shown) is hung acts as a switch, and when depressed with the receiver in place the bell circuit is connected with the line. On removing the receiver, the lever springs up, breaking the bell connection and placing the transmitter and receiver in circuit. A ringing key is situated on the left-hand side of the box.

On speaking into the transmitter, the valve formed by this carbon cone became partially unseated, and produced variations of resistance due to imperfect contact. The receiver is of the membrane type.

Object entry information: This telephone set has a Mix and Genest transmitter of the carbon pencil type, made under the patents of Mr. W. Genest in 1887 and Mr. H. Oppenheimer in 1891. Two carbon pencils are used, the reduced ends of which enter large-sized holes in two rectangular carbon blocks, which are fixed to the diaphragm. Between the pencils, and pivoted in the two carbon blocks, is a bridge which carries on its lower side a flat brush of stiff bristles which bears against the pencils, so that their ends are always in contact with the surface of the holes in the carbon blocks. The brush also prevents independent rolling motion of the pencils, which is one of the probable causes of a jarring noise being heard in the receiver when a carbon pencil microphone is used in a vertical position. The lever with which the receiver (not shown) is hung acts as a switch, and when depressed with the receiver in place the bell circuit is connected with the line. On removing the receiver, the lever springs up, breaking the bell connection and placing the transmitter and receiver in circuit. A ringing key is situated on the left-hand side of the box.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co., Liverpool.
Date of creation: Made in 1900.
Object entry information: A. B. Strowger, the inventor of the first successful automatic telephone exchange, filed his original application for a patent in America in 1889. The earliest public exchange worked on this system was opened at La Porte, Ind., in 1892. The instrument exhibited is an example of the early type of wall telephones arranged for connection to a Strowger automatic telephone exchange. A complex dialling switch was used with each instrument, and the case is left partially open to show the interior portion of this. In modern practice, the apparatus at the subscribers' premises is of a much more simple character. Situated at the base of the dialling switch are the coils of a magneto bell, the two gongs of which are on the front of the case. A magneto generator is fitted inside the box as hand-ringing was necessary with this instrument. In modern exchanges machine-ringing is general. The lower part of the case contained the primary cells required for the speaking circuit before the central battery system was adapted to automatic telephone transmission. A. B. Strowger was an undertaker in Kansas City, and frequently used the telephone for business purposes. This originated his desire to substitute machine operation for manual operation. Between the years 1892 and 1902 progress was slow, but with the adoption of new inventions and improvements the automatic telephone extended its influence in all parts of the world and many of the largest exchanges are now worked on the automatic principle. The first public automatic telephone exchange in this country was installed at Epsom in 1912. Other systems of automatic telephone exchanges are the Siemens, the Western Electric, &c. (See also Cat.

Object entry information: A. B. Strowger, the inventor of the first successful automatic telephone exchange, filed his original application for a patent in America in 1889. The earliest public exchange worked on this system was opened at La Porte, Ind., in 1892. The instrument exhibited is an example of the early type of wall telephones arranged for connection to a Strowger automatic telephone exchange. A complex dialling switch was used with each instrument, and the case is left partially open to show the interior portion of this. In modern practice, the apparatus at the subscribers' premises is of a much more simple character. Situated at the base of the dialling switch are the coils of a magneto bell, the two gongs of which are on the front of the case. A magneto generator is fitted inside the box as hand-ringing was necessary with this instrument. In modern exchanges machine-ringing is general. The lower part of the case contained the primary cells required for the speaking circuit before the central battery system was adapted to automatic telephone transmission. A. B. Strowger was an undertaker in Kansas City, and frequently used the telephone for business purposes. This originated his desire to substitute machine operation for manual operation. Between the years 1892 and 1902 progress was slow, but with the adoption of new inventions and improvements the automatic telephone extended its influence in all parts of the world and many of the largest exchanges are now worked on the automatic principle. The first public automatic telephone exchange in this country was installed at Epsom in 1912. Other systems of automatic telephone exchanges are the Siemens, the Western Electric, &c. (See also Cat.

PXL_20251126_132628533.jpg,,WORKING MODEL OF THE AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE SYSTEM FOR THE LONDON AREA.,Lent by the General Post Office.,1924,"The problem of linking up very large area by means of automatic telephone exchanges is naturally an extremely complex one. Means must be provided whereby a subscriber on any automatic exchange may connect himself with any subscriber on his own or any other exchange, and the connection must be made in such a manner as to make the most economical use of lines and automatic switches. Moreover, during the period of transition which must elapse before the whole system has been converted to automatic working, special apparatus must be provided to deal with calls between the existing manual exchanges and the new automatic exchanges. After a prolonged study of the problem, the British Post Office Authorities have decided that the system to be installed in the London Area shall be based on the well-known Step-by-Step system, with the addition of the important “Director” principle. The function of the Director is to receive and store the subscriber’s call in its original form, and to proceed to send it out into the exchange switching mechanism, translated into any trains of impulses which may be required by the existing lay-out of junction routes and switching centres. Having steered the call through, link by link, to the line of the required subscriber, the director disconnects itself from the line and becomes available for other calls. Another important feature of the system is the Coder Call Indicator. This switchboard is the connecting link between a subscriber on an automatic exchange and a subscriber served from a manual exchange. It is a fine example of engineering skill, permitting impulses received from the automatic subscriber to be translated by the Director to be reproduced in the manual exchange in the form of an illuminated display of the required number. For traffic in the opposite direction various methods may be adopted, one of which—the use of cordless “B” positions—is included in this exhibit. The model, which was originally constructed for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, is probably for its size the most complex mechanism extant. Six exchange switching centres are represented, access to these being given by a number of automatic telephones included in the exhibit. During the hours when the model is shown in operation, visitors may make test calls with these instruments, and may trace their progress through the various units and observe the manner in which calls from one automatic exchange to another, or between a manual and an automatic exchange, are dealt with.",Inv. 1925-913.,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

The first successful attempt at machine telephone switching on the part of a British engineer was that of Mr. D. Sinclair, who in 1883 patented a semi-automatic device which dispensed with an operator at a branch exchange and provided for the control of calls from the distant central exchange where an operator was in attendance. A set of this apparatus is shown under Cat. No. 135. A working model of the latest automatic equipment which is to be installed in the London telephone area has recently been received by the Museum, and forms the central feature of the section.
