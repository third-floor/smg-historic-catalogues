Object entry information: To provide additional points for the control of the detailed survey, traverse lines are run between third or fourth order triangulation points with a theodolite by which, at each change of direction of the traverse line (traverse point), the azimuth of the forward line is measured. All such traverse points in towns are now marked by means of a brass bolt, into the top of which can be fitted the 15-in. observing rod or the foot of the traverse pole. For temporary marks the bolts are cemented into the curb of the pavement. For permanent marks a 30-in. iron socket, similar to the base of an iron telegraph pole (Figs. 1 and 2) is rammed into the ground till the top is 9 to 12 in. below the surface. The socket is filled with cement or concrete, and the bolt cemented in at the top. The number of points so marked varies according to the nature of the survey. In some continental cadastral surveys the average number is 20 to 50 per square kilometre in the country, and 100 to 150 in towns. In the highly cultivated land of Egypt where holdings are small but the land is level and unobstructed by hedges, about 16 to 20 per square kilometre are used.

Object entry information: This brass bolt forms the station mark at a geodetic station of the Survey of Egypt. It is provided with two saw-cuts intersecting at right angles, and is cemented into a concrete block in the ground. Accurately built into the concrete block is an iron cylinder filled with concrete, having gaps in the bottom so that the mark can be seen. A brass and cast iron tribrach (see Cat. No. 14) is accurately centred over the mark and cemented in the top of the pillar. Upon this tribrach the theodolite rests when sighting to the station, whilst to its centre is screwed a heliograph or lamp when sighting to the station.

Object entry information: This brass tribrach is built into a masonry pier and accurately centred over the concealed mark at geodetic stations in Egypt.

Maker/Donor: Presented by H. Dray, Esq.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The liability of ordinary metal bolts and bars used as traverse marks in Egypt to removal, led H. Dray to devise this land-anchor type of mark, which is now successfully employed in the soft soil of the Nile Valley and elsewhere. The mark consists of a conical iron cap securely attached to the head of a screw pile which is buried some 6 ft. below the ground and is connected to the cap by a 1/4-in. steel cable. The cap has a central socket to receive the ranging rod and rests on a circular concrete block interposed between it and the ground. In order to drive the pile into the ground, its flexible cable is enclosed in an iron pipe of suitable length. A nut threaded on the pile-head keeps this pipe pressed against the pile at its lower end, where the pipe and pile are notched so as to interlock. The two then form a rigid pile which is driven into the ground by rotating the pipe with the pipe-grips shown. When only the head of the pile remains above ground, the nut is unscrewed and the pipe withdrawn, the space round the cable being filled with rammed earth. The concrete block, about 1 ft. diameter by 4 in. thickness, has a central hole and is next fitted over the pile-head by means of the keys shown. The adjacent diagram illustrates the process of fixing the mark in position.

Maker/Donor: Made in the Museum.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: A number of fundamental bench marks have been fixed in the principal (first order) levelling lines in the British Isles for the purpose of verification from time to time. These bench marks are fixed in rock in order to ensure permanence and immunity from accidental disturbance. One visible mark and two concealed marks, the altitudes of which are accurately known, are provided.
A recess having been excavated in sound and unweathered rock, the two reference points A and B are set in a bed of concrete. Mark A is a dome-headed bolt of bronze; mark B is a polished flint selected as being unlikely to deteriorate in any way. A third mark, C, is a bronze dome-headed bolt bearing the words ""height above datum,"" and the altitude in feet. This is set in a granite pillar which rises 12 in. above the ground, and on which the name plate D is fixed.
Examples of the bronze bolts A and C and the name plate D, and also of the coverplate protecting the two lower marks A, B, are shown near by. The upper mark C is used for all ordinary purposes of levelling, whilst the concealed marks serve to determine whether secular changes of level are in progress.
The distance between fundamental bench marks varies from 25 to 35 miles.

Object entry information: When excavating near the pyramid of Seneferu (III Dynasty) at Meidum in 1891, Sir W. Flinders Petrie uncovered four corner walls of crude brick built round the angles of a rectangular tomb structure known as a ""Mastaba."" On the inner faces, which were plastered and whitewashed, level lines were drawn in red at intervals of one cubit, and numbered to show the distance of each below the ""ground level"" (nfrw). The sloping black lines show the inclination of the outer face of the masonry ""Mastaba.""
The hieroglyphic inscriptions in red record that the line to which they refer is 3, 4 or 5 cubits below ground level.

Object entry information: A number of fundamental bench marks have been fixed in the principal (first order) levelling lines in the British Isles for the purpose of verification from time to time. These bench marks are fixed in rock in order to ensure permanence and immunity from accidental disturbance. One visible mark and two concealed marks, the altitudes of which are accurately known, are provided.
A recess having been excavated in sound and unweathered rock, the two reference points A and B are set in a bed of concrete. Mark A is a dome-headed bolt of bronze; mark B is a polished flint selected as being unlikely to deteriorate in any way. A third mark, C, is a bronze dome-headed bolt bearing the words ""height above datum,"" and the altitude in feet. This is set in a granite pillar which rises 12 in. above the ground, and on which the name plate D is fixed.
Examples of the bronze bolts A and C and the name plate D, and also of the coverplate protecting the two lower marks A, B, are shown near by. The upper mark C is used for all ordinary purposes of levelling, whilst the concealed marks serve to determine whether secular changes of level are in progress.
The distance between fundamental bench marks varies from 25 to 35 miles.

These consist of a gun-metal plate set flush with the surface of a wall, and having an identification number cast on it. The reference point, to which the published altitude corresponds, is the top of the ""broad arrow."" In levelling, the foot of the levelling staff is brought to the same altitude as this point with the aid of a detachable bracket and a small spirit-level. (See ""The Second Geodetic Levelling of England and Wales, 1912-1921,"" p. 14, Plate XI.—Ordnance Survey, 1931."")

Object entry information: This bracket is an old type of angle iron used to support the levelling staff at an Ordnance Survey broad arrow bench mark. It has a short arm which is fitted into the horizontal groove engraved above the broad arrow, and a longer inclined supporting arm which abuts against the wall in which the mark was notched. A series of circular depressions are sunk in the upper face to receive the stud on the base of the staff, the lower level of the depressions being a horizontal plane passing through the centre line of the engraved groove. This type of supporting bracket was superseded by the modern one represented in the next example.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The type of mark now employed in India varies according to the character of the neighbourhood. In towns or cities the standard bench mark is used, as being less liable to interference than the metal bolts employed in Europe. In places where there is an outcrop of hard rock, the mark is made on this and suitably protected, as in the centre diagram. The embedded type of mark is more suitable in country districts, where no ground-rock or permanent stone building is available. The ""standard"" type of bench mark was first employed in 1904. It consists of a stone monolith of 2 ft. square section, 3 ft. high, set upon a foundation of concrete 6½ ft. square by 2 ft. deep. The top of the monolith is cut in the form of a frustrum of a pyramid, and terminates in a square of 3 in. side, the central point of which constitutes the mark. The date of construction of the monolith is engraved on it, together with the inscription ""G.T.S. Standard Bench Mark,"" whilst the height of its reference point above sea-level at Karachi is engraved upon a stone slab embedded in a brickwork setting round the base of the monolith. The bench-mark inscribed upon ground-rock is protected by a masonry column, closed at the top by means of a stone slab on which is engraved the inscription ""G.T. Survey, Upper Mark."" The ""embedded"" bench mark consists of a 4-in. iron pipe embedded in well-rammed earth about 2 ft. below the ground level. A brickwork arch on concrete abatments is built over this mark in order to distribute the weight of traffic passing near. Above this arch is more rammed earth surrounding a central brickwork well, closed by a stone cover with the usual inscription. This type of mark has only recently been introduced, the previous type of ""embedded"" mark being a cubical stone block buried with its upper face slightly below the ground level.

Object name: DIAGRAM OF BENCH MARKS. Survey of India. Made in the Museum.
Maker/Donor: Survey of India.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The type of mark now employed in India varies according to the character of the neighbourhood. In towns or cities the standard bench mark is used, as being less liable to interference than the metal bolts employed in Europe. In places where there is an outcrop of hard rock, the mark is made on this and suitably protected, as in the centre diagram. The embedded type of mark is more suitable in country districts, where no ground-rock or permanent stone building is available. The ""standard"" type of bench mark was first employed in 1904. It consists of a stone monolith of 2 ft. square section, 3 ft. high, set upon a foundation of concrete 6½ ft. square by 2 ft. deep. The top of the monolith is cut in the form of a frustrum of a pyramid, and terminates in a square of 3 in. side, the central point of which constitutes the mark. The date of construction of the monolith is engraved on it, together with the inscription ""G.T.S. Standard Bench Mark,"" whilst the height of its reference point above sea-level at Karachi is engraved upon a stone slab embedded in a brickwork setting round the base of the monolith. The bench-mark inscribed upon ground-rock is protected by a masonry column, closed at the top by means of a stone slab on which is engraved the inscription ""G.T. Survey, Upper Mark."" The ""embedded"" bench mark consists of a 4-in. iron pipe embedded in well-rammed earth about 2 ft. below the ground level. A brickwork arch on concrete abatments is built over this mark in order to distribute the weight of traffic passing near. Above this arch is more rammed earth surrounding a central brickwork well, closed by a stone cover with the usual inscription. This type of mark has only recently been introduced, the previous type of ""embedded"" mark being a cubical stone block buried with its upper face slightly below the ground level.

Object name: PHOTOGRAPHS OF TRIANGULATION BEACONS.
Maker/Donor: Presented by Major G. G. Waterhouse, R.E.
Date of creation: 1910–12.
Object entry information: These two photographs illustrate the construction of quadripod triangulation beacons at Ado Rock and Awba Hill stations during the survey of Southern Nigeria, 1910–12. The beacons are formed of tree-trunks and branches built up into a four-sided pyramid, the upper part of which is roofed with brushwood to form a prominent land-mark, and at the same time to protect the surveying instruments when taking bearings from the station. A pole carrying at its upper end a white flag is fixed to the top of the beacon to render it more conspicuous. The right hand photograph shows the framework of the beacon built up, but the roof not yet added. The left hand photograph shows a completed beacon, with a heliograph, theodolite and plane table standing beneath it. The ground in the vicinity has been carefully cleared of obstacles to view.

It is of the double mirror type, and is provided with a sighting telescope and a smaller collimating telescope for adjusting the reflected beam of sunlight in the direction of the observing station.
The instrument consists of two elliptical plane mirrors, mounted upon a long arm which can rotate about a horizontal axis in the standard, the latter being furnished with the usual three levelling screws. The arm is provided with a spirit level clinometer and declination compass. Each mirror is so mounted on the arm that it can be set normal to any required direction, and has slow-motion tangent screws for accurate adjustment. There are two telescopes arranged so that their axes are always parallel to each other at a fixed distance apart but point opposite ways. The smaller telescope is directed towards the reflecting mirror, and, by means of it, the beam of sunlight reflected from this mirror projects upon a small screen, mounted at a suitable distance from its eye-piece end, an image of the sun and the cross-wires of the telescope. When the centre of the sun's image coincides with the intersection of the image of the cross wires, the axis of the telescope is parallel to the direction of the reflected beam. Hence the beam is directed parallel to the axis of the larger telescope, which is focussed on to the observing station, and the observer will see the flash of the heliograph. The necessary adjustments to effect this are made with the mirrors. (See “Journal of Telegraph Engineers,” 1878, pp. 351–355.)

Object entry information: This lamp is an acetylene projector designed by Mr. G. T. McCaw for use in trigonometrical surveys. It was first used in the measurement of an arc of meridian in Uganda, and later in the Royal Siamese Survey Department.
Its light can normally be seen at a distance of 30 miles. It is provided with a telescope for directing the beam, and with means for attachment to a rough table so as to be in the direct line between the observer and the mark at its own station.
The lamp is of ordinary motor design, with a separate carbide container, the gas being conveyed to the burner by flexible tubing. In the barrel is a single lens of about 5-in. aperture, movable slightly along the barrel for correct focussing.
The projector has independent traversing, azimuthal and vertical motions. When in use its lower plate is firmly screwed to a rough table in an approximate line between the station mark and the observer. Its orientation having been approximately corrected by the azimuthal and vertical motions, the projector is then accurately aligned by the traversing motion, operated by the handle on the left-hand side of the lower plate, and is clamped in this alignment. The axis of the barrel is then moved up or down, according to the indication of the telescope, by the vertical motion screw under the back of the barrel. This screw passes through the upper and middle plates, which are kept down to the lower plate by a spring and stop. Finally, the upper plate to which the barrel is rigidly attached, is swung in azimuth over the middle plate. When the telescope, attached to the upper plate, is directed on the observer's station, the upper plate is clamped by the wing nut under the front of the barrel. The axis of the projector is then correctly aligned on the distant station and the position of the burner is in the direct line between the local and distant triangulation points.
In the original form, a sighting tube affixed to the top of the barrel replaced the telescope.

Jäderin, on the other hand, suspended his wires, of which two were used to measure each base independently, freely between fixed tripods, and measured the distance between each pair of tripods by means of scales engraved on the tapes (see No. 65). The two wires were of different metals, and thus formed a bi-metallic combination for determining the mean temperature during measurement, and they were stretched by a constant tension so that the sag could be calculated and allowed for. Invar tapes (see No. 69) or wires, either suspended freely between two tripods as in Jäderin's method, or supported at a few intermediate points on tripods carefully aligned with the two end ones, have superseded the rigid types of base apparatus in the most recent geodetic and topographical work.

Maker/Donor: Made by Spencer & Perkins, London. Lent by F. G. Ogilvie, Esq., C.B.
Date of creation: Late 18th or early 19th century
Object entry information: This is probably a late 18th or early 19th century pedometer and differs from earlier examples in having a more delicate escapement, actuated by the sudden stoppage in the motion of the wearer’s body at each step. The long hook is used to suspend the instrument from the fob of the person carrying it. As usual the escapement is effected by the withdrawal of a spring pawl, attached to one end of a rocking lever, from the teeth of a small ratchet wheel. In this instrument the teeth are very fine, so that the pawl slips over four teeth at each oscillation. The lever is normally kept in the ""down"" position by a fairly strong spring, but the pull of this spring is considerably reduced by slightly raising the long hook projecting from the top. The lower end of this hook is fixed to a chain wound round a drum mounted on the same spindle as the rocking lever. The hook is raised when the instrument is fitted in its case by inserting a pin in a hole in the lower end of the hook, the ends of the pin resting in brackets on the top of the case. In this position, the rocking lever is just balanced, and is very sensitive to small jerks. The instrument has three dials and pointers registering miles, tenths, and thousandths of a mile. The pointer of the thousandths dial is connected to the ratchet wheel and so geared that it moves 176 times in one revolution, i.e. in one tenth of a mile. The pedometer is mounted separately from its case for exhibiting the movement mechanism.

Object entry information: This instrument was made about 1800 and consists of a pedometer and a watch mounted in the same case and having a common face, with separate dials and pointers. The pedometer movement is effected by the tension of a string, which is attached at one end to the wearer’s leg, and at the other to a delicately poised rocking lever controlling by its oscillations the engagement of a spring pawl in a ratchet wheel. The large pedometer dial is graduated to record every hundred double paces; there is a smaller one to register every ten double paces, and a third to record each double pace.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Evan Roberts, Esq.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The movement here exhibited is of the type invented by W. Payne in 1831 and still used in modern pedometers. The escapement of the recording ratchet wheel is effected by the oscillations of a horizontal anchor-shaped pendulum, whose moment about its pivot is just more than balanced by the pressure of a control spring. The sudden jerk caused by the stoppage of the downward motion of the wearer’s body at each step is sufficient to make the pendulum oscillate.

The wheel is much larger, its circumference being half a pole, and it is carefully mounted in its bearings so as to reduce friction and shake. The mechanism differs slightly from that in the Waywiser. The motion of the rotating axle of the wheel is transmitted to a perpendicular shaft running along the top to the case containing the recording mechanism by a pair of bevel wheels, and from the shaft to the recording mechanism by a worm and worm-wheel. One of the bearing forks is hinged at the top to the case containing the recording mechanism. The outer dial has a diam. of 7 in. and is graduated in yards and poles, its pointer making one revolution every furlong. An inner dial, of 5 in. diam. is graduated in furlongs and miles up to 10 miles and is read by a second index. The wheel and mechanism case are made of wood, with metal parts where there is much wear, e.g. the axle and bearings, wheel rim, etc. (See Adam's ""Geometrical and Graphical Essays,"" 1813.)

The motion of the rotating axle of the wheel is transmitted to a perpendicular shaft running along the top to the case containing the recording mechanism by a pair of bevel wheels, and from the shaft to the recording mechanism by a worm and worm-wheel. One of the bearing forks is hinged at the top to the case containing the recording mechanism. The outer dial has a diam. of 7 in. and is graduated in yards and poles, its pointer making one revolution every furlong. An inner dial, of 5 in. diam. is graduated in furlongs and miles up to 10 miles and is read by a second index. The wheel and mechanism case are made of wood, with metal parts where there is much wear, e.g. the axle and bearings, wheel rim, etc. (See Adam's ""Geometrical and Graphical Essays,"" 1813.)

The teeth of the ratchet are very fine, so that as the pendulum moves from the upper stop to the lower, the pawl passes over several teeth, the number depending upon the adjustment of the lower stop, which is threaded in a fixed block. By this adjustment, the indication of the recording pinion can be varied to correspond roughly to the length of the observer's stride. The ratchet wheel is geared to a train of pinion wheels which record the distance travelled in miles and furlongs. There is only one dial and pointer, the former graduated in miles up to twelve, with eight sub-divisions to each mile. The numbering of the main graduations is like that used in watches.

The example shown was made in the late 18th century. It has a brass wheel of 1.5 ft. circumference geared to a registering mechanism furnished with dials and pointers which record the number of links, poles, chains, furlongs, and miles traversed. The bearings for the wheel axle are fixed to metal brackets screwed to the case containing the registering mechanism, which itself is fixed at the lower extremity of a long wooden handle. At one end of the axle is a small pinion wheel the teeth of which engage in those of a perpendicular pinion mounted on the lower end of a brass rod, which is pivoted at its lower end in the axle bearing block and kept parallel to the supporting bracket by guides. The upper end of this rod is geared to the case containing the registering mechanism. This has two pointers and dials, the outer one divided to read links and having divisions both every ten links and every pole, whilst the inner dial is graduated in miles and half furlongs up to four miles.

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: first employed about 1620.
Object entry information: The chain most generally used in England for land measurement is named after its inventor, Edmund Gunter, and was first employed about 1620. It has a length of 66 ft. made up of 100 links, so that 10 square chains equal one acre. The example shown is made of iron, with brass handles, as was formerly the custom. This type has been replaced by the chain made of steel wire, of No. 8 or No. 12 B.W.G. which stretches much less than an iron chain after use. In all Gunter’s chains, brass tellers are inserted at every 10 links, for convenience in estimating fractional lengths.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: A steel band of this type is preferred to a chain by many land surveyors, partly because, length for length, it is lighter and also because it preserves its length much better after the strain of constant usage. On the other hand, it is not so durable as a chain, nor so easily read. The example shown is 50 ft. long, and is divided every foot, the two terminal feet being subdivided into inches. The divisions are marked by brass studs of various sizes, an oval plate being substituted for the stud at every 10 ft. and marked by perforation to show the length from the nearer end. The handles are made of brass, with swivel joints. The whole is wound up in a metal case which has a narrow slit for inserting the handle at one end. A strap is attached to the case for carrying it. The band is $\frac{5}{8}$ in. wide and of No. 26 B.W.G. thickness.

Object entry information: The instrument has a trailing wheel of diam. 18 in. made of steel, with an aluminium band on its rim to prevent snow from clinging to the surface and with steel pegs fitted into the rim so as to enable the wheel to roll without slipping on ice surfaces. The wheel is mounted in ball bearings upon a metal fork to which the recording mechanism is attached. The gearing is completely enclosed and the dial gives reading in geographical miles, subdivided to 25 yd. The fork is fixed to a wooden bar to which at the other end is attached a cross-head connected to the bar by a universal joint. This permits the instrument to follow the track of a sledge without partaking of its lateral movements. The instrument gave satisfactory readings over soft snow surfaces but registered too low on a very hard surface owing to the steel spikes giving a variable periphery.

Object entry information: Although no map of landed property in ancient Egypt has come down to us, representations of land measurers at work have been made upon tomb walls. This photograph shows the scene depicted upon the walls of the tomb of one Menna at Sheikh Abd el Qurna, in Thebes, a land overseer and inspector of the boundary stones of Amon (Circa. 1400 B.C.). Two ""chain"" men, or ""rope stretchers,"" are shown measuring a field of corn with a long cord on which are knots or marks at intervals apparently of 4 or 5 cubits; each also carries a spare cord coiled up on his arm. Beside them walk three officials carrying writing materials and a bag probably containing documents and plans relating to the property. An old man and two boys also accompany the surveyor and a peasant brings a loaf of bread and a bunch of green corn. In a similar scene pictured on the walls of a tomb belonging to a certain Amenhotep, also at Sheikh Abd el Qurna, it is possible to see that the measuring cord terminated in a ram's head.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The ""qassaba"" (qassaba, a rod, Arabic) is a Syrian unit of length which has been employed in land surveying in Egypt for the past ten or twelve centuries. Previous to a decree dated 1861, its actual length varied considerably at different times and in different parts of the country, but it was then defined as being equal to 3·55 m., the unit of area (feddan) then becoming 333$\frac{1}{3}$ square qassabas instead of 400. A ""qassaba"" rod, with its ends tipped with metal, is here exhibited, with photographs showing the rod in use.
The land-measurer (messah) holds the rod by the middle and places it successively along the line to be measured by turning it over on the forward end. Skilled ""messahin"" obtain remarkably good results but they can also easily vary the measurement towards excess or defect when turning over the rod. At the present time all official land-measurements in Egypt are made with the steel chain, but the qassaba-rod is still used in the villages for sub-dividing holdings or measuring up crops.

Each rod has alternate metres painted red and white, and each metre is subdivided by small studs into decimetres. They are made of well-seasoned fir, painted and varnished to prevent variations in length due to atmospheric moisture. The rods are usually round or oval in section and vary in thickness, tapering towards the ends, which are flat and tipped with metal. They are used of various lengths, 3, 4 or 5 metres being the most usual, and 2 metres in towns where narrow alleys occur. In measuring a length, the rods are used in pairs, being placed successively in contact and aligned on the distant point which is marked by a ranging rod.

Object entry information: In comparing a wooden measuring rod of the type used in cadastral surveys with the corresponding standard, it is usually necessary to measure very accurately the small distance between one end of the rod and the end of the standard. For this purpose, a steel measuring wedge of uniformly varying thickness is inserted between the two terminals. The one exhibited has a uniform variation in thickness of 1 mm. per 1 cm. of its length. Its length is graduated in millimetres, reading by estimation to tenth-millimetres, and thus giving the corresponding thickness to 0·01 mm., within a range of error of 0·01 mm.

Object entry information: In comparing a wooden measuring rod of the type used in cadastral surveys with the corresponding standard, it is usually necessary to measure very accurately the small distance between one end of the rod and the end of the standard. For this purpose, a steel measuring wedge of uniformly varying thickness is inserted between the two terminals. The one exhibited has a uniform variation in thickness of 1 mm. per 1 cm. of its length. Its length is graduated in millimetres, reading by estimation to tenth-millimetres, and thus giving the corresponding thickness to 0·01 mm., within a range of error of 0·01 mm.

Object name: ""QASSABA"" MEASURING ROD.
Maker/Donor: Presented by Captain H. G. Lyons, F.R.S.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The ""qassaba"" (qassaba, a rod, Arabic) is a Syrian unit of length which has been employed in land surveying in Egypt for the past ten or twelve centuries. Previous to a decree dated 1861, its actual length varied considerably at different times and in different parts of the country, but it was then defined as being equal to 3·55 m., the unit of area (feddan) then becoming 333$\frac{1}{3}$ square qassabas instead of 400. A ""qassaba"" rod, with its ends tipped with metal, is here exhibited, with photographs showing the rod in use.
The land-measurer (messah) holds the rod by the middle and places it successively along the line to be measured by turning it over on the forward end. Skilled ""messahin"" obtain remarkably good results but they can also easily vary the measurement towards excess or defect when turning over the rod. At the present time all official land-measurements in Egypt are made with the steel chain, but the qassaba-rod is still used in the villages for sub-dividing holdings or measuring up crops.

The telescope here exhibited was used to sight between the two terminal tripods upon boning rods set up at the subdivision points. The movable vanes of these rods being adjusted until their index lines lay on the axis of sight of the telescope, the height of the intermediate tripods was thus ascertained. The telescope has a rack-focussing objective lens of 1·2 in. aperture and 13 in. focal length, and a fixed eyepiece of the Huygens type, with a fixed cross-wire diaphragm between the two lenses. The magnifying power of the eyepiece is small, and the telescope can be focussed down to a few feet.

Object entry information: The apparatus here illustrated was designed by W. Struve and used by him in measuring seven bases of the principal triangulation of Russia, 1817–1855. It consists of four wrought iron bars enclosed in wooden cases, supported near the ends on trestles. The chief peculiarity of the bars is the use of spring contact levers. The temperature was measured directly by thermometers whose bulbs rested in cavities in the bar. Struve estimated the mean probable error of his bases as 1 in 7,250,000. Each iron bar is 2 toises (nearly 4 m.) long, and has a square section of 3·4 cm. side. It terminates at one end in a small steel cylinder, having a slightly convex outer face. To the other end is pivoted a lever with unequal arms. On the lower arm is a polished hemisphere, pushed outwards from the bar by a weak spring. The steel cylinder of the adjacent bar makes contact with this hemisphere, and forces the longer arm of the lever to traverse a vertical graduated scale. Any slight variation in length of the bar is correspondingly magnified by the lever on the scale, and can be accurately measured. Two mercury thermometers are placed with their bulbs in recesses in each bar, and serve to measure the temperature directly. There is also a spirit level attached to determine the inclination of the bar. (See “Encyclopædia Britannica,” XI Edition, Article “ Geodesy.”)

This apparatus was designed by Major-General Colby, R.E., in order to eliminate the errors in measuring bases caused by the impossibility of estimating accurately the temperature of the measuring bars at the time of observation. The device of Colby consists in so connecting two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, that two reference marks on metal tongues attached to them remain at an invariable distance apart whatever the temperature. Two bases have been measured with this apparatus, one in the North of Ireland in 1827-28, and the other on Salisbury Plain in 1849. Ten bases have been measured with similar apparatus in India. In this apparatus two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, each 10 ft. 1.5 in. long, 0.3 in. broad and 1.5 in. deep at a certain temperature, are placed in a deal box, and firmly connected at their centres by two small transverse steel cylinders, nearly in contact. Near each extremity of the double-bar is a metal tongue, 6.2 in. long, which is connected to each bar by pivots so as to permit expansion, but no other movement of the bars. On a silver plug at the extremity of each tongue is engraved a dot—the compensation point. Since the lengths of the tongue between the dot and either bar is proportional to the coefficient of expansion of that bar, no joint expansion of the bars due to temperature changes will affect the position of the dot. Consequently the dots are 10 ft. apart at all temperatures. The compound bar is placed in a deal box, and is kept from moving lengthwise by a brass stay fixed firmly to the bottom of the box at the centre and projecting upwards between the two small steel cylinders connecting the bars. A long steel cross-wise level is fixed to the top of the brass bar and read through a glass covered opening in the top of the box. The tongues carrying the compensation points project beyond the box, but are carefully protected. In measuring, the boxes are supported at their quarter and three-quarter points on stands which permit lateral and longitudinal motion. The dots on two adjacent bars are brought to the precise distance of 6 in. apart by means of a compensation microscope. This latter is formed by uniting two microscopes by parallel bars of iron and brass in such a manner that the distance between their outer foci remains exactly 6 in., whatever the temperature. The whole apparatus consists of six bars and seven microscopes, of which two bars and three microscopes are exhibited. The rate of measurement with this apparatus was six bars per hour on the Lough Foyle base.

Although it was only used as a preliminary to more precise measurements with both fir and glass rods, General Roy was so impressed by its accuracy that, in measuring the base of verification on Romney Marsh in 1787, he used the chain only, and discarded the wooden and glass rods. The chain has 100 links, each 1 ft. long. The joints at every 10 ft. are at right angles to the remainder, which permits the chain to be folded so as to fit into a box about 14 in. by 8 in. by 8 in. for transport. Brass plates are attached at the joints to indicate 10 ft. lengths along the chain. In the rough measurement of the Hounslow Heath base, the chain appears to have been simply stretched along the ground, but in the measurement at Romney Marsh it was supported on deal coffers, 20 ft. long, resting on carefully aligned posts driven into the ground every 20 ft. along the base. Thus supported, the chain was stretched by a weight of 28 lb., the temperature being measured by thermometers laid in the coffers near the chain.

Object name: BONING TELESCOPE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by the Royal Society.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: In measuring the Hounslow Heath base in 1784, General Roy divided the base into sections of 200 yd. and erected tripods of fixed height for supporting the measuring rods at each division point; these sections were subdivided into segments of 20 ft., corresponding to the lengths of the deal measuring rods used, and intermediate tripods set up at the subdivision points with their platforms adjusted so as to be in the line connecting the platforms of the tripods at each end of the section. The telescope here exhibited was used to sight between the two terminal tripods upon boning rods set up at the subdivision points. The movable vanes of these rods being adjusted until their index lines lay on the axis of sight of the telescope, the height of the intermediate tripods was thus ascertained. The telescope has a rack-focussing objective lens of 1·2 in. aperture and 13 in. focal length, and a fixed eyepiece of the Huygens type, with a fixed cross-wire diaphragm between the two lenses. The magnifying power of the eyepiece is small, and the telescope can be focussed down to a few feet. It has square brass collars shrunk on to its tube near each end to support it upon the platform of the tripod. (See Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1785.)

Object entry information: The apparatus here illustrated was designed by W. Struve and used by him in measuring seven bases of the principal triangulation of Russia, 1817–1855. It consists of four wrought iron bars enclosed in wooden cases, supported near the ends on trestles. The chief peculiarity of the bars is the use of spring contact levers. The temperature was measured directly by thermometers whose bulbs rested in cavities in the bar. Struve estimated the mean probable error of his bases as 1 in 7,250,000. Each iron bar is 2 toises (nearly 4 m.) long, and has a square section of 3·4 cm. side. It terminates at one end in a small steel cylinder, having a slightly convex outer face. To the other end is pivoted a lever with unequal arms. On the lower arm is a polished hemisphere, pushed outwards from the bar by a weak spring. The steel cylinder of the adjacent bar makes contact with this hemisphere, and forces the longer arm of the lever to traverse a vertical graduated scale. Any slight variation in length of the bar is correspondingly magnified by the lever on the scale, and can be accurately measured. Two mercury thermometers are placed with their bulbs in recesses in each bar, and serve to measure the temperature directly. There is also a spirit level attached to determine the inclination of the bar. (See “Encyclopædia Britannica,” XI Edition, Article “ Geodesy.”)

1925 - geodesy and surveying_page_27.png,65.0,JÄDERIN BASE MEASURING APPARATUS.,Presented by the Survey of Egypt.,,"This apparatus for measuring geodetic bases is of the type first employed by Jäderin in Sweden in 1885, and was used in Egypt for determining second order bases from 1901 to 1907. In Jäderin’s system, the massive rigid base-bars hitherto employed were replaced by light metallic wires or tapes freely suspended under a constant tension. The saving in labour and time thus effected easily outweighs the slight loss in accuracy sustained. Independent measurements of each section of the base are made with two wires of different metallic structure, and the effect of temperature variations is thus calculated. The apparatus exhibited comprises two tripods and two pairs of wires, 25 and 50 metres long respectively, each pair consisting of one brass and one steel wire. The tripods are provided with steel observing pins mounted upon double ball and socket joints, which permit slight displacements of the pins when the tripods are fixed. The wires are nickel-plated, and are provided at each end with decimetre scales, graduated in millimetres. The centimetre divisions of these scales are numbered from 5 to 15, and the length of the wire between the “10” division at each end is the characteristic length. The wires terminate beyond the scales in loops, to which are attached the flexible cords carrying the straining weights. The tension may be applied by hand, and measured by a spring balance, or by attaching weights to the cords. The cord at each end passes over a pulley or trestle, which serves to take the end strain and to adjust the scale of the wire during the actual measurement into close proximity to the side of the observing pin. Observations of the positions of each pin with respect to the corresponding scale are simultaneously recorded. Several dual observations are made with each wire of a pair, the wire being slightly displaced before each observation. Previous to the actual measurement of any bay, the pins of the tripods marking the ends of that bay are carefully aligned and their heights determined by a transit theodolite and level. With this apparatus, various bases in Egypt were measured with probable errors between 1 in 200,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 at a speed of about 1,000 metres per day. The higher degree of accuracy was consistently attained when the 'constants' of the wires were known properly, and the observing parties had gained experience in correctly applying the tension to the wires. Recently the invention of 'invar' has obviated the employment of two wires in the Jäderin system, and with improved straining mechanism, it is now possible to measure bases with Jäderin 'invar' wires or tapes with an accuracy high enough for first order triangulation purposes.

Object entry information: accurately the temperature of the measuring bars at the time of observation. The device of Colby consists in so connecting two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, that two reference marks on metal tongues attached to them remain at an invariable distance apart whatever the temperature. Two bases have been measured with this apparatus, one in the North of Ireland in 1827-28, and the other on Salisbury Plain in 1849. Ten bases have been measured with similar apparatus in India. In this apparatus two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, each 10 ft. 1.5 in. long, 0.3 in. broad and 1.5 in. deep at a certain temperature, are placed in a deal box, and firmly connected at their centres by two small transverse steel cylinders, nearly in contact. Near each extremity of the double-bar is a metal tongue, 6.2 in. long, which is connected to each bar by pivots so as to permit expansion, but no other movement of the bars. On a silver plug at the extremity of each tongue is engraved a dot—the compensation point. Since the lengths of the tongue between the dot and either bar is proportional to the coefficient of expansion of that bar, no joint expansion of the bars due to temperature changes will affect the position of the dot. Consequently the dots are 10 ft. apart at all temperatures. The compound bar is placed in a deal box, and is kept from moving lengthwise by a brass stay fixed firmly to the bottom of the box at the centre and projecting upwards between the two small steel cylinders connecting the bars. A long steel cross-wise level is fixed to the top of the brass bar and read through a glass covered opening in the top of the box. The tongues carrying the compensation points project beyond the box, but are carefully protected. In measuring, the boxes are supported at their quarter and three-quarter points on stands which permit lateral and longitudinal motion. The dots on two adjacent bars are brought to the precise distance of 6 in. apart by means of a compensation microscope. This latter is formed by uniting two microscopes by parallel bars of iron and brass in such a manner that the distance between their outer foci remains exactly 6 in., whatever the temperature. The whole apparatus consists of six bars and seven microscopes, of which two bars and three microscopes are exhibited. The rate of measurement with this apparatus was six bars per hour on the Lough Foyle base. (See Ordnance Survey “Report on Measurement of Lough Foyle Base,” pp. 163, 164.)

The apparatus consists of two precisely similar base-bars, known as the U.S. C. & G. S. Nos. 13 and 14 measuring bars. Each bar is of the contact-slide metallic-thermometer type, and is 5 m. long at a certain temperature. The actual measuring unit is a steel rod 8 mm. in diam., terminating at one end in an agate plane, and at the other in a contact-slide which itself ends in an agate knife-edge. The slide is connected to the rod by a spring, and has a mark engraved upon it corresponding to a mark engraved upon the rod, so that when these two knife-edge and plane terminal points are the correct distance apart. Two zinc tubes, 9.5 mm. in diam., are soldered one to each end of the steel rod, their other ends being free to expand or contract relatively to this rod. The relative expansion is measured by means of a vernier on each zinc tube moving over a scale fixed to the steel rod, and the compound rod thus formed enables the mean temperature to be determined. The compound measuring rod rests upon rollers in a rectangular wooden case, which itself rests upon tripods during the measurement and is provided at its rear end with a telescope for aligning the bar. When the forward bar has been aligned and adjusted as a whole on its trestles to within a small distance of the preceding bar, its measuring rod is slowly drawn backwards upon the rollers by a milled screw at its rear end, until the contact-slide touches the agate plane of the preceding bar and is forced gently over the steel rod until the two engraved lines coincide. During this motion, the wooden case remains stationary upon its trestles, and the only pressure upon the rear bar is that due to the spring of the contact-slide, which is quite powerless to disturb the bar. Each bar is provided with a mercurial thermometer for use when comparing it with the standard bar. The average rate of measurement with this apparatus on the Holton Base was 155 m. per hr., with a probable error of about 1 in 1,500,000. (See Special Publication No. 4, U. S. C. & G. S.

Object name: ""INVAR"" MEASURING TAPE.
Maker/Donor: Made by J. H. Agar Bough.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The name ""invar"" has been given to a nickel-steel alloy containing from 35 per cent, to 36 per cent. nickel, discovered by Dr. C. E. Guillaume in 1896, owing to its low coefficient of expansion for temperature, which is not greater than 1·0 x 10⁻⁶ per °C. The application of this alloy to geodesy arises from the difficulty of ascertaining the exact mean temperature of a metal measuring unit, and consequently the precise length of the unit at the time of measurement. As the effect of an error of this type is directly proportional to the expansibility of the metal, the importance of a low coefficient of expansion is obvious. The use of ""invar"" wires or tapes, suspended under a constant tension of about 10 kg., according to Jäderin’s method, is now almost universal in measuring bases for triangulation of the first or second order. The tape exhibited is just over 100 ft. long, and has scales divided to read two-hundredths of a foot at each end. According to the National Physical Laboratory certificate of examination, the length between its zero marks at each end is 100·001 ft. at 58·5° F., under a tension of 10 kg., with an accuracy of 1 in 100,000. The width of the tape is 5 mm. and its thickness 0·5 mm. It is wound upon an aluminium drum of 16 in. diam., which can rotate upon its pivot as the reel is unwound.

Date of creation: Inv. 1911-151.
Object entry information: This instrument is used to measure ranges in the ordinary manner, by solving a very acute right-angled triangle. The angle subtended at the distant point is constant, whilst the base is variable, and is measured by pacing. Three reflecting right-angled prisms are mounted by hinged joints near the objective of a small telescope, so that any one of the three can be set to reflect rays axially along the telescope from directions at 90°, 88° 51′ 15″ and 74° 53′ 15″ respectively. The first prism is used to set off the base at right angles to the direction of the distant object. The observer paces in the line of the base until, using one of the other two prisms, he again sees the object by reflection. For both observations the telescope is directed to view another distant point at right angles to the target, i.e., in the direction of the base. The number of paces taken between the two observations, multiplied by a constant depending upon the length of pace and the reflecting angle of the second prism used, gives the required range. The constant is determined experimentally.

Date of creation: about 1865.
Object entry information: This rangefinder was designed by Capt. Gautier, a French artillery officer, about 1865, and has been extensively used in the French army. Its main feature is a thin prism mounted in a ring at the object end of the sighting tube. By rotating the ring the deviation of rays in the plane of the distant object and the horizontal through the instrument can be varied continuously, and the ring calibrated correspondingly. The sighting tube is about 5 in. long by 1·5 in. diam. and has a protecting tube which can be fitted underneath to serve as a hand-grip when observations are being made. The sighting tube, in addition to the movable ring containing the prism, has a pair of plane mirrors having their faces inclined to each other at an angle of about 45°, and so inclined to the optical axis that rays incident through a window in the side of the tube in a direction nearly perpendicular to the axis, are doubly reflected at the mirrors into the line of the axis, and pass through a small telescope at the eye end of the tube. In the instrument shown, two such telescopes of different powers are fixed side by side. One of the mirrors can be slightly rotated so as to vary the angle of deviation of the reflected rays. In using the instrument, the observer sets the range scale on the movable ring at “infinity” and the index of the movable mirror at the centre. He views the distant object by double reflection at the mirrors and looks directly through the tube and prism for a convenient aiming mark. If such a mark is not quite co-incident with the image of the distant object, he rotates the mirror until coincidence occurs. Then the object and the aiming mark are in directions nearly perpendicular to each other. Next he paces out a convenient distance in the direction of the aiming mark and takes a second observation similar to the first, but this time effects the coincidence by means of the movable prism. He reads off the scale calibrated on that ring when coincidence is effected and multiplies the distance of his base. The result is the range of the distant object. The movable ring is really calibrated to record the reciprocal of the angle of deviation caused by the prism, which is the same as the reciprocal of the angle subtended.

Object entry information: This is a pocket rangefinder suitable for military reconnaissance. To determine ranges up to 3,000 m. two observations are made with it, one from each end of a 30 m. base, which is set off approximately at right angles to the direction of the object. The instrument consists of a short metal tube having a pin-hole sight at one end and a rectangular window in one side. Opposite this window within the tube are two small plane mirrors inclined at an angle of 45° to each other. Both mirrors can be rotated slightly. The observer views the object A whose range is required directly through the pin-hole sight, and rotates one mirror until he sees, after double reflection, the image of an object B whose direction is nearly perpendicular to A's. He measures off the base in the direction of B, and again views A directly. By rotating the second mirror he once more gets a doubly reflected image of B. This latter rotation is effected by turning a milled drum in the eye end of the instrument, and the position of this drum when B is again sighted is a measure of the range of A. The drum is calibrated to give this range immediately. A thin cord of the base length is supplied with the instrument. (See “Fieldwork and Instruments,” 1900, pp. 236-239, by A. T. Walmisley.)

Object entry information: This type of rangefinder was designed by P. Adie in 1860, and was extensively used by the Admiralty until superseded by the Barr and Stroud pattern. The example shown was used on H.M.S. “Triton” from 1885 to 1904 during the survey of the East Coast of England. The rangefinder consists of two systems of lenses and right-angled reflecting prisms mounted in a 3-ft. metal tube of square section. Each system forms a “broken” telescope, the objectives being at each end of the tube, along which the rays, originally perpendicular to it, are deflected by right-angled prisms to the centre, where they are again reflected at right angles into the common central eye-piece. In this manner two images of a distant object whose direction is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the tube are obtained, one through each system. These images will be separated laterally by an interval which diminishes continuously as the range increases, but does not become zero until the object is at an infinite distance. If the objective lens and two prisms of one system are separately mounted and can be rotated with respect to the other system, the two images may be made to coincide by such a rotation, and the angle of rotation necessary will vary inversely as the range of the object. This angle can be obtained by calculation, or a table of corresponding values. In the instrument exhibited such an arrangement is effected by mounting one object lens and its pair of reflecting prisms in a separate tube within the main tube containing the other set, and pivoted to this so that the rotation can be effected by a screw threaded in the outer tube with its end pressing against the inner. The angle of rotation is measured by a vernier on one tube and a scale nearest second of arc, and the range read off on a table fixed to the outer leather protecting cover.

As this base has been made nearly perpendicular to the direction of the object, the product of its length and the reciprocal of the angle gives the range. Thus any convenient base length can be used subject to the condition that it subtends an angle of not more than 3° at the distant object. (See “ Notice sur le Télémètre de Poche,” by A.

Object entry information: This standard rangefinding set is used by infantry units. It comprises two optical sighting instruments, known as the “Right Angle” and “Reading” instruments, and two reels of cord, each 25 yd. long, for setting off the base. The observer at one end of the base uses the “Right Angle” instrument to make the base line perpendicular to the line joining his position to the distant object, after which the other observer uses his “Reading” instrument to measure the angle between the base line and the direction of the object from his position. The Right Angle instrument has two fixed vertical mirrors inclined to each other at an angle of 45°. The observer using this sees the target directly and the vane on the Reading instrument after double reflection at the two mirrors. He adjusts his position, keeping the base line fully extended, until the two images coincide. The Reading instrument differs only in that one of its mirrors can be rotated, and the rotation recorded upon a graduated drum, so that the images of the target (viewed directly) and the vane of the Right Angle instrument (viewed by double reflection on the two mirrors) can be made to coincide. The graduated drum is calibrated to record the range directly. (See “ Handbook of the Mekometer.”)

Object name: ADIE TELEMETER.
Maker/Donor: Presented by the Admiralty. (Designed by P. Adie in 1860).
Date of creation: Designed in 1860.
Object entry information: This type of rangefinder was designed by P. Adie in 1860, and was extensively used by the Admiralty until superseded by the Barr and Stroud pattern. The example shown was used on H.M.S. “Triton” from 1885 to 1904 during the survey of the East Coast of England. The rangefinder consists of two systems of lenses and right-angled reflecting prisms mounted in a 3-ft. metal tube of square section. Each system forms a “broken” telescope, the objectives being at each end of the tube, along which the rays, originally perpendicular to it, are deflected by right-angled prisms to the centre, where they are again reflected at right angles into the common central eye-piece. In this manner two images of a distant object whose direction is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the tube are obtained, one through each system. These images will be separated laterally by an interval which diminishes continuously as the range increases, but does not become zero until the object is at an infinite distance. If the objective lens and two prisms of one system are separately mounted and can be rotated with respect to the other system, the two images may be made to coincide by such a rotation, and the angle of rotation necessary will vary inversely as the range of the object. This angle can be obtained by calculation, or a table of corresponding values. In the instrument exhibited such an arrangement is effected by mounting one object lens and its pair of reflecting prisms in a separate tube within the main tube containing the other set, and pivoted to this so that the rotation can be effected by a screw threaded in the outer tube with its end pressing against the inner. The angle of rotation is measured by a vernier on one tube and a scale nearest second of arc, and the range read off on a table fixed to the outer leather protecting cover.

The rangefinder is of the F.A. 2 type, base 4 ft. 6 in., mounted on a type N.M. naval mounting which permits the tube to be rotated in azimuth and altitude. Its optical system is functionally similar to that of the adjacent early infantry type, but special reflecting prisms replace the mirrors there employed. The two images formed in the central eyepiece are erect, and are separated by a fine horizontal line bisecting the field. Coincidence of these images is effected by moving a deflecting prism to which is attached a scale whose lateral motion is measured and indicates the required range as in the earlier instrument. The scale can be illuminated for night reading, when a cylindrical lens astigmatiser is put into action and serves to draw out the images of a luminous point into fine vertical streaks suitable for effecting coincidence. The instrument can be adjusted at a known range by “halving” and “coincidence” fittings, and will then read all ranges correctly.
The approximate uncertainty of measurement varies from 2 yd. in 1,000 to 200 in 10,000, the percentage error increasing directly with the range. The magnification of the main telescope system is 26 diam., its angular field of view 1° 20′ horizontally and 0° 40′ vertically. The finder telescope magnifies 2·5 diam. and has a 7° field of view.

Object entry information: Prof. Forbes designed this type of rangefinder in 1901, for use by infantry in measuring ranges up to 3,000 yd. The power of the eyes to “converge” to a varying degree upon objects at different distances, and to measure distances by the muscular effort so required, is limited normally to small distances of a few yards. Consequently, in this, as in all stereoscopic rangefinders, optical means are employed to bring the image of the object ranged upon within the limit of normal eye convergence. The use of an optical base, whose function is to increase the inter-ocular distance from 2·5 in. to 72 in., and a pair of binoculars of magnification 8 diam. enables the radius of stereoscopic vision to be increased 240 times.
In this instrument, the optical base consists of two pairs of doubly reflecting pentagonal prisms, mounted one at each end and two at inter-ocular distance apart in the centre of a metal tube, which is hinged in the centre so as to fold into two portions each 38 in. long. When in use these two portions are clamped to form a single tube with the end prisms 72 in. apart. The binoculars are fitted with their objectives opposite the centre prisms, there being windows in the tube opposite all the prisms.

It is 4 in. long and is graduated to read 0·02 in. directly, whilst it can be moved on the plate, parallel to its own length, through a small interval by means of a micrometer screw with a graduated drum, which measures 0·002 of each division of the scale. In this manner the ultimate graduation of the scale corresponds to 4 × 10⁻⁵ in. so that, if n such divisions are traversed when the theodolite rotates from the upper to the lower mark of the staff, the distance of this staff from the instrument will be 15 × 10³ ÷ n ft. In other respects the instrument is similar to an ordinary transit repeating theodolite. It has 5-in. vertical and horizontal circles reading by vernier to single minutes. The focal length of the telescope is 11 in., and its aperture 1·25 in. It is fitted with a Ramsden eyepiece. Slow-motion tangent screws are provided for each circle, and the usual spirit-levels on the plate and telescope. A diagonal eyepiece is fitted to the microscope for convenience in taking steep sights.

Object entry information: Ordinary tacheometers are designed for horizontal sights, and the readings have to be corrected by computation if the sight is inclined, whilst a further calculation is necessary to determine the difference in height between the observed and observing stations. Many devices have been introduced in the design of tacheometers with the object of rendering such calculations unnecessary, and enabling the distance and altitude to be read off directly, whether the line of sight is horizontal or inclined. The tacheometer illustrated embodies Prof. H. H. Jeffcott’s arrangement for rendering the readings independent of the inclination. A similar arrangement of varying diaphragm-interval enables the height also to be obtained by reading the staff-interval intercepted. The diaphragm has one fixed and two movable horizontal platinum-iridium pointers, the former for collimation and the latter to limit the intervals for height and distance readings respectively: the distance pointer is on the same side as the collimation pointer, and the height pointer on the opposite side. Each movable pointer is fixed on the end of a pivoted lever, of which the other end is pressed against a suitably shaped cam, which is rotated by the movement in inclination of the telescope, so that the distance of either movable pointer from the fixed one is suitably varied to make the interval intercepted upon the distant staff exactly one-hundredth of the range and one-tenth of the height respectively. The cams are made to suit elevations and depressions up to 30°, and are mounted inside a protecting case at one end of the transit axis of the telescope.

In the tacheometer invented about 1868 by A. Gentilli, the Austrian engineer, a rigid vertical arm can be clamped to the transverse axis of the telescope in any position. The lower end of this arm can only move a short distance, being limited by two mechanical stops. Consequently the vertical angle through which the telescope can move when clamped to the arm is likewise limited. The instrument in other respects is like an ordinary theodolite of the type made by Stärke about this period. It has a 5-in. horizontal circle and a 3.5-in. vertical quadrant, both reading by vernier and reading microscope to 30'' and having the usual clamps and tangent screws. The telescope has an objective lens of 12 in. focal length and 1.5 in. aperture. The instrument has four levelling screws, two small spirit levels mutually perpendicular on the horizontal circle, and a more sensitive one on the telescope.

Object entry information: An early example of a theodolite modified to enable distances to be measured with it simultaneously with azimuth and altitude angles is here represented in the “Omnimeter,” invented by C. A. C. Eckhold in 1868. This instrument is used in conjunction with a special tacheometric staff having a fixed interval, usually 10 ft., marked upon it. A microscope, rigidly attached with its axis perpendicular to that of the observing telescope, rotating with this telescope about a common transverse axis, measures upon a scale fixed horizontally upon the upper plate of the theodolite the distance traversed when the observing telescope is rotated from the upper mark to the lower mark of the staff. As this staff is always set up vertically, its horizontal distance from the centre of the instrument is inversely proportional to the distance traversed on the scale. The microscope scale is mounted parallel to the telescope at a distance of exactly 6 in. below the transverse axis. It is 4 in. long and is graduated to read 0·02 in. directly, whilst it can be moved on the plate, parallel to its own length, through a small interval by means of a micrometer screw with a graduated drum, which measures 0·002 of each division of the scale.

Object entry information: This type of level was invented by Col. Burel in 1829, and operates upon the principle that in a vertically suspended mirror the eye sees a reflected image of itself at its own level. The instrument consists of a rectangular frame, suspended in gimbal bearings so as to hang vertical owing to its own weight. The frame contains a piece of plane glass, of which one vertical half is silvered and the other half left free for direct vision of a distant object. A horizontal cross wire bisects the two parts. The observer holds the instrument in front of his eye and moves it until he sees the reflected image of his eye bisected by the cross wire. Any distant object then intersected by the wire will be at the level of his eye. (See ""Memorial de l'Officier du Génie,"" No. 10, 1829.)

Object entry information: This level was constructed in the early part of the 19th century and used in 1831 by J. A. Lloyd, F.R.S., in ascertaining the differences of level between the Thames at London Bridge, Sheerness and various intermediate points. The telescope has a focal length of 28 in. and is finally levelled by means of a 12-in. spirit level mounted at one side parallel to its axis. The objective lens of the telescope has a 2-in. aperture, and is fixed in the tube, the eyepiece tube being focussed by a rack and pinion arrangement and having a fixed diaphragm and a slide focussing Ramsden inverting eyepiece. The telescope is attached to a transverse horizontal axis, which rests in Y-s on standards fixed to the horizontal plate. The telescope is supported near both ends by vertical screws threaded in the ends of a rigid bar fixed to the horizontal plate parallel to the axis of the telescope. These screws are used in the final adjustment of the telescope axis, which is tested by the main spirit level. This bar is suspended from the ends of a metal rod fixed on one side of the telescope, and has ivory scales graduated to thirtieths of an inch mounted above its bubble-tube. A small level is also fixed transversely at one end of the main level. The bubble of the latter moves over one division of the scale when the telescope is elevated about 2 seconds of arc. The horizontal plate can rotate about a vertical axis, and has a clamp and tangent screw for slow motion. It is attached to a pair of parallel plates, connected by four levelling screws of the usual type. A small circular spirit-level is fixed to the plate above its centre for setting it horizontal. The telescope can be reversed in its Y-s end for end, or rotated through 180° about its own axis, as in all Y-levels. (See Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1831.)

Object entry information: This level was made about the year 1830 and was used in 1831 by J. A. Lloyd, F.R.S., in measuring the differences of level between the Thames at London Bridge, Sheerness and various intermediate points. It has a 30-in. telescope mounted in Y-s in a manner similar to the ordinary Y-level, but is fitted with an extra spirit level suspended above the telescope, and also has a circular supporting base resembling that of a large theodolite and resting on three footscrews. The objective lens of the telescope has a 2-in. aperture and is fixed in the tube, the eyepiece tube having a rack and pinion focussing movement. The eyepiece is of the Ramsden inverting type and is also focussed by a rack and pinion movement. Gun-metal collars are shrunk on to the telescope near its extremities and rest in Y-s fixed to the horizontal circle. One of these Y-s can be adjusted vertically by means of a screw. This adjustment serves to level the telescope more precisely than is possible with the footscrews. The 14-in. horizontal circle can rotate about a vertical axis, and has a clamp and tangent screw. It also carries a central 31-in. compass, graduated in degrees, and a small thermometer. The

Object entry information: Of the many arrangements for converting a Burel reflecting level into a clinometer, the one here represented, devised by General A. De Lisle, R.E., is the most satisfactory. A heavy arc is attached to the lower part of the mirror frame and can be turned into the same plane as the mirror for convenience of carriage, or into a perpendicular frame for measuring angles of elevation or depression. In the latter position the weight of the arc causes the mirror plane to take up an inclination to the vertical, which can be varied by means of a movable radial arm, concentric with the arc and carrying a sliding counterpoise at its extremity. The arc is so graduated on its edge that the position of one edge of the movable arm gives the inclination of the mirror, and, therefore, of the line of sight between the observer's eye and its reflection in the mirror. The arc is graduated to read gradients from zero to 1 in 5.

Object entry information: This level was formerly the property of George Stephenson, and was used by him at Chat Moss in the survey for the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, 1829. It is of the type designed and constructed by Troughton, the spirit-level being rigidly fixed in the telescope, which is not reversible, as in the Ramsden type. Such an instrument, whilst incapable of preliminary adjustment, is very simple and rigid in construction, and is well suited for engineering surveys. A small compass, supported on four pillars, is provided for traversing. The telescope has an aperture of 1 1/4 in. and a focal length of 15 in., and is provided with stops. The eyepiece tube is focussed by a rack and pinion arrangement actuated by a screw. The diaphragm can easily be disclosed for examination by removing the eyepiece. There are two eyepieces provided, one erect and the other inverting. The bubble-tube is 10 in. long, and has a radius of curvature of about 50 ft., giving a motion of the bubble of 1/5 in. for every minute of arc. The compass ring is 2 1/2 in. in diameter, and is graduated to read single degrees.

Object entry information: This instrument was made about the middle of the 19th century, and was used until 1907 for levelling minor lines. The spirit level is attached by adjusting screws to the telescope, which fits in Y-shaped bearings, and can be rotated or reversed in these for adjustment of the line of collimation. The parallel plate arrangement for levelling the instrument is of the usual type, with four levelling-screws, axis clamp and tangent-screw for slow-motion. The telescope has a focal length of 12 in. and an aperture of 1.25 in., and is provided with stops. The focussing is carried out at the objective end by means of a rack and pinion arrangement, actuated by an external screw. The diaphragm containing a horizontal and vertical wire is easily accessible after unscrewing the eyepiece, which is arranged to give an erect image of the staff. The bubble-tube is 7 3/4 in. long, and is graduated in tenths of an inch. The internal radius of curvature of the tube is about 80 ft., giving a movement of the bubble of 0.1 in., corresponding to a change of elevation of 20 seconds.

Object entry information: A level of this type, serving also for measuring inclines and distances by means of the elevating screw, is particularly adapted by reason of its compactness and simplicity of construction for preliminary surveys where no great accuracy is required. It consists of a small telescope and spirit-level separately mounted upon a platform connected with a tripod by means of a ball-and-socket joint of a special type, often employed in small surveying instruments of German construction. This joint permits the orientation of the platform to be varied, whilst leaving it perfectly free to rotate in azimuth about the socket, which is fixed to the tripod. The platform terminates underneath in a metal ball, at the lower end of which is a cylindrical pin. The socket consists of two parts screwed together, an upper spherical dome enclosing the ball, and a lower tubular sheath surrounding the pin. Two levelling screws, set perpendicularly to each other, work in threads in this sheath, and impinge upon a metal collar which encircles the pin sufficiently tightly to prevent shake, but not to hinder the free azimuthal rotation of the pin, and consequently the platform. Opposite the two screws, and likewise impinging on the collar is a spring which takes the pressure of the screws. By means of these screws the platform can be set level in all directions. The spirit level can be adjusted upon the platform by the small screws at one end of its case, whilst the telescope can be elevated or depressed about an axis at one end fixed in the platform by means of a fine-threaded screw at the other end. The pitch of the screw-threads is half a millimetre, and the movement of this end of the telescope is read to a tenth of a millimetre with the aid of a graduated disc and vertical millimetre scale. For every tenth-millimetre, the line of sight of the telescope moves through an angle whose circular measure is one-thousandth. By this means, as in tacheometry, distances can be measured with fair accuracy.

The special features which distinguish it from an ordinary small level are the graduated semicircle and the peculiar method of attaching the spirit level to the telescope and the whole instrument to the tripod.

The spirit level can also be attached to the telescope in two places, one serving when the semicircle is horizontal and the other when it is vertical. The telescope can rotate on the semicircle, which is graduated to 30 minutes and reads by vernier to 2 minutes, and the semicircle can likewise rotate irrespective of the telescope, thus permitting angles to be “repeated.” The diameter of the graduated semicircle is 18 cm.

Object name: BREITHAUPT'S COMPENSATION LEVEL.
Maker/Donor: Made by F. W. Breithaupt and Son, Cassel.
Date of creation: 1859
Object entry information: This is a later modification of a level designed and constructed by F. W. Breithaupt in 1845, with the idea of minimizing the instrumental adjustments usually necessary as a preliminary to taking levels. The method of weighting the main spirit level and suspending it freely in pin bearings attached to the telescope enables the surveyor to compensate by double readings the errors arising from non-parallelism of the spirit-level axis, telescope axis, and line of sight. In this level the telescope can be rotated in its collars through a complete half-turn, the extreme positions being determined by mechanical stops. The spirit level, whilst revolving with the telescope, does not rotate, but is kept with its engraved scale uppermost. Consequently the bubble is always visible against the scale, and its variation during the rotation measures the extent to which the axis of the spirit level is inclined to the axis of rotation of the telescope. Such an inclination, if small, will be automatically rendered ineffective provided two readings of the levelling staff are made with the spirit level “centred,” one before the telescope is rotated in its collars through 180°, and the other after. This double reading also corrects for lack of coincidence between the mechanical axis of rotation of the telescope and the line of sight. The mean of the two readings will be the true reading which would be obtained if the three axes of spirit level, telescope rings and vision were mutually parallel. Thus it is not necessary to adjust the instrument beforehand for this parallelism. It is, however, essential that the spirit level itself should be so adjusted that when its bubble is central, its own axis of rotation reversing the spirit level in its bearings should be horizontal. This can be tested by centring the bubble, and reading the bubble again. Half the difference is removed by the means of the two capstan-headed screws which fix one end of the bubble tube to its case. To enable the spirit level to be so reversed, one bearing pin can be withdrawn from its supporting bracket. The lower part of the instrument is provided with a circular box level, which serves to set the main axis nearly vertical by means of the footscrews. No attempt is made to render this axis exactly vertical, as the telescope is always finally levelled by means of the elevating screw. The head of this latter is divided, and serves to measure very accurately small gradients. The diaphragm of the telescope has two horizontal subtense wires in addition to the central levelling wires, so that the instrument can be used to measure distances. The “suspension” spirit level of the type here shown was soon superseded in compensating levels by Amsler’s two-sided “reversion” level, which is much less liable to be injured by shocks than Breithaupt’s pattern. See “Dingler’s Polytechnisches Journal,” Bd. 133, p. 401, 1859.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: A “precise” level, designed for work of the highest possible degree of accuracy, in addition to its greater sensitivity and power, possesses several features not found in ordinary levels. The chief characteristics are the additional facilities for finally levelling the telescope by means of a micrometer screw and a very sensitive bubble, which is read by a supplementary optical arrangement at the same time as the staff, and the protection of the bubble and all movable parts from temperature changes. In the level exhibited, which was introduced by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey about the year 1900, the main bubble tube is sunk well inside the outer telescope tube, which is also covered by felt cloth. A system of mirrors and a supplementary telescope with its eyepiece at binocular distance from the main telescope, enable the observer to read at the same time the staff with his right eye and the ends of the bubble with his left.
The main telescope has an objective of 1.7-in. aperture and 16-in. focal length, mounted in a tube containing the rack focussing eye-piece tube. The objective tube is pivoted near the object end to the cloth-covered outer tube and near the eyepiece end rests on a micrometer screw. By turning this the objective tube can be slightly inclined in the vertical plane through the staff and station point until the bubble, which is fixed to it, is centred. The outer tube itself can rotate about the vertical axis of the instrument and has a tangent clamp and screw for slow-motion in azimuth. A tribrach with three footscrews supports the whole instrument and serves to level it approximately, with the aid of a small box level on the outer telescope tube. The telescope can be lifted from contact with the micrometer screw and clamped inside the outer tube by a lever bar near the micrometer. This arrangement preserves the micrometer from unnecessary use and friction. The micrometer drum is graduated in 100 divisions, each corresponding to the 2-mm. divisions on the main bubble, *i.e.*, to 2 seconds of elevation. The eyepiece tube of the main telescope has a cross-wire diaphragm, with two horizontal stadia lines; two inverting eyepieces, of magnifications 32 and 44, are supplied. The supplementary telescope has a plain aperture eyepiece and two diagonal reflecting prisms which, in conjunction with a plane mirror fixed to the outer telescope tube, reflect the image of each end of the bubble and scale down the axis of the telescope. All the parts of the main telescope which affect the adjustment of its line of collimation are made of “invar.”

Object entry information: the screw does not impinge on the socket, but on an intermediate lever arm pivoted horizontally at the other end of the platform and in contact with the socket near this pivot. A spring connecting the socket and platform keeps the former pressed against the lever arm. By this arrangement the weight of the telescope is taken off the elevating screw and its rotation about the central pivot is only a small part of what it would be without the lever arm.
The micrometer drum of the elevating screw is divided to read single minutes of elevation of the telescope and can be used for measuring distances; the stadia lines of the telescope diaphragm can also be used for this purpose.

Object entry information: The telescope of this level has a rack-focussing objective of 1.3-in. aperture and 14-in. focal length. A 6-in. bubble-tube is mounted adjustably beneath it and has a sensitivity of 22 seconds per 0.1 in. division of its graduations.
The telescope is supported in Y-s by means of gun-metal collars, 8 in. apart, and can be rotated in its Y-s or reversed end for end in the usual manner. The Y-s are permanently fixed to a supporting platform of very rigid construction, but two screws threaded in the arms of one Y permit the telescope to be raised or lowered in that bearing to take up wear. The hinged retaining clips of the Y-s have metal springs attached which keep the collars pressed down on their bearings; one of these springs has a pointed toe which engages in a groove notched in the collar when the telescope is in the normal observing position, *i.e.*, the bubble vertically below its axis.
The supporting platform has a conical axis and can rotate in azimuth within the tribrach levelling base; an axis clamp and tangent screw are provided. Three footscrews are threaded in the tribrach and have their feet firmly clamped in a trivet stage, which can be screwed to a tripod head or can stand on a platform by means of its three pointed feet. The footscrews have dustproof caps threaded in the tribrach to protect their heads and to take up wear.

Object entry information: In a hand-level it is desirable that the object sighted and the levelling mechanism should be simultaneously visible. The combined level and clinometer designed by Capt. Abney, R.E., about the year 1870, utilizes the idea of reflecting the bubble of a spirit level into the line of sight of the sighting tube by means of a diagonal mirror fixed in one half of the latter, the other half being left free for sighting the object. This device had been previously used on a sextant. In the instrument exhibited, a graduated semicircle is rigidly fixed to the rectangular sighting tube, which has a pin-hole aperture and a diagonal mirror fixed beneath a slit in its upper face, vertically beneath the centre of the arc. Through this centre passes an axis, carrying a small transversely mounted spirit level at one extremity and a vernier arm near the other, which terminates in a large milled wheel. On rotating this wheel the spirit level is set at any angle to the line of sight, the angle being measured by the position of the vernier on the graduated arc. The cover of the spirit level has apertures above and below, the latter permitting an image of the bubble to be seen after reflection on the mirror, whilst the former is used when the clinometer is set on the surface whose gradient is required. The arc is graduated in degrees up to 60° on both sides of the vertical, and reads by vernier on the movable arm to 10 minutes. It also has a scale of gradients to 1 in 1, read by the edge of the vernier. The sighting tube is 4 3/8 in. long and the graduated arc has an effective radius of 1 in.

Object entry information: This example differs from the preceding one in minor details. The graduated arc is fixed to the spirit level and revolves with it, being read for angles up to 45° either way by means of a fiducial mark on the supporting bracket, which is fixed to the sighting tube. Scales of gradients up to 1 in 1 are also marked on the arc beyond the degree graduations and are read by the bevelled edges of the supporting bracket. The edge of the arc is milled, and gears with a small pinion wheel centred in the fixed bracket and rotated by a milled screw.

Object entry information: This is a modern Service clinometer for measuring to the nearest minute the angle of elevation of a plane surface. The angle is measured to the nearest degree by a rotating arm which traverses a fixed graduated sector attached to the base. The arm is slightly curved on its upper and lower surfaces, and carries a sliding spirit level whose position, when the bubble is central with respect to the scale graduated on the arm, gives the number of minutes in the angle.

The bubble level is mounted within a gunmetal frame which has two surfaces accurately machined at right angles to each other. One end of the level is pivoted to the frame, and the other end is kept pressed against the base of the drum which rotates upon a threaded screw carried by the frame. As the drum rotates, an index on the scale the resulting elevation of the free end of the level above the pivoted end, and hence, when the bubble is centred, the elevation of the plane upon which the frame is set. No sights are provided with this instrument, which is designed for recording the slope of a plane surface with respect to the vertical or horizontal, according to which of the two plane surfaces of the instrument is in contact with the surface tested. The range of the drum scale is from 40 minutes below to 45° above zero, the first 5° being subdivided by dots to 1 minute; thereafter lines indicate every 5 minutes.

The instrument consists of a hollow bubble arm mounted upon a gunmetal base, which has three studs on its lower face. The bubble arm is pivoted at one end to the base, and carries an adjusting screw at its other end for setting the bubble central. A folding sight vane is fitted to each end of the bubble arm, the shorter vane having a fixed aperture backsight and the longer one carrying the sliding foresight. The latter vane has two scales engraved upon it, one of degrees, subdivided to 20 minutes, and the other of tangents. The range of the scale is 0°-23° of elevation or depression.

The vane is moved by the observer signals that it is in line with the telescope, when the former takes the reading of an index mark on the bevelled edge of a small opening in the vane. This method of levelling was superseded about 1835 by the modern one, in which the observer himself reads the staff through the telescope, an improvement rendered possible by the improved telescopes used. The face of the staff is graduated both in inches, divided to tenths, and also in hundredths of a foot along its whole length save the top 3 in. Another rod of slightly smaller section can slide along the back of the first, being retained in position by a metal band which serves as a friction clamp. This second rod is not divided and merely serves as a stand for extending the graduated rod. Both are tipped with brass at their ends. A second vane, similar to the first, is supplied.

The remaining sixteen are tube levels, six of them having their glass containers bent as a whole into a circular shape, and the other ten being straight tubes, internally ground to various curvatures according to the desired sensitivity. The first six are not very sensitive, and are of the type used by carpenters, masons, etc. The other ten are used on surveying instruments, etc., and are usually mounted in brass cases, attached to the instrument by adjustable screws. On the larger levels of this type, division marks are graduated at 0·1 in. interval for reading the positions of the ends of the bubble, and the sensitivity is indicated by the angle of elevation of the level necessary to cause the bubble to move over one division. The most sensitive one exhibited has a sensitivity of 1 division per 5·5 seconds of elevation. This particular bubble tube has also a separate chamber at one end. When the bubble expands owing to increasing temperature, a portion of the air can be detached and transferred to the supplementary chamber through a small aperture in the separating wall, and the bubble thus reduced to its normal size.

Object name: LEVELLING ROD.
Maker/Donor: Lent by T. H. Court, Esq.
Date of creation: 18th century
Object entry information: This staff was made in the 18th century and consists of a graduated wooden rod 6 ft. long, 1 in. wide, and in. deep, over which can slide a sighting vane, which has a sharply defined diamond of dark wood inlaid upon a face of light wood, and fits closely to the face of the rod. The vane is moved by the observer signals that it is in line with the telescope, when the former takes the reading of an index mark on the bevelled edge of a small opening in the vane. This method of levelling was superseded about 1835 by the modern one, in which the observer himself reads the staff through the telescope, an improvement rendered possible by the improved telescopes used. The face of the staff is graduated both in inches, divided to tenths, and also in hundredths of a foot along its whole length save the top 3 in. Another rod of slightly smaller section can slide along the back of the first, being retained in position by a metal band which serves as a friction clamp. This second rod is not divided and merely serves as a stand for extending the graduated rod. Both are tipped with brass at their ends. A second vane, similar to the first, is supplied. Each has a circular shape, of diameter 5 in. The inlaid diamond has diagonals 5 in. and 2 in., the longer bisecting the vane horizontally. Pins and a metal spring fixed to the back of the vane keep it in position on the rod.

Object entry information: This is an inextensible wooden staff 10·5 ft. long, having a rectangular section 2 in. wide by 1 in. deep, and is graduated in hundredths of a foot so as to be read through the telescope by the observer himself. The face of the staff is sunk slightly below the edges to preserve the graduations from abrasion. The graduation marks consist of black horizontal bands 0·01 ft. wide at uniform intervals of 0·01 ft. apart. The 0·1-ft. bands stretch right across the staff, the remainder occupying the left portion only, save at the 0·05-ft. points, where there is an additional black mark to the right of the corresponding white band. Large black numbers, horizontally set, mark the feet, the tenths being marked by smaller black numbers set vertically. A diamond is used instead of the number “five” on the latter graduations, and a dot is placed near the “nine” to distinguish it from the “six” when the numbers are seen inverted in the field of the telescope.

Object entry information: The advantages of a metal scale for levelling staves have until recently been counterbalanced by the tendency of such scales to expand when heated, and the difficulty of ascertaining their temperature in order to apply the necessary correction. The invention of “invar”—a nickel-steel alloy of negligible temperature coefficient—has now led to its employment in levelling rods used in precise surveys. The example shown is the lower portion of such a rod. The invar rule is painted white and engraved with black bands at intervals of 0.02 ft., every fifth band extending over the complete width (about 2 cm.) of the rule, and the others over half its width. The rule is then screwed into a central recess in the face of the wooden rod, which has an I section for strength and lightness, and is shod with a metal shoe terminating in a flat base plate; the bottom of the invar rule is flush with this plate. The face of the wooden rod is painted white and numbered opposite the marks corresponding to intervals of 0.1 ft. on the invar rule. The numbers are in black, and are inverted so as to be seen erect in the telescope of the level; a V is used instead of 5 and an N instead of 9. At the divisions of the rule corresponding to an integral number of feet from the base plate, large red numbers are painted on the wood, and are twice repeated in smaller sized numbers on the opposite side of the face so that the observer has always one of the red numbers in the telescope field. In estimating the position of the cross wire with respect to the graduated scale of the rod, the nearest 0.02-ft. mark is taken and the remaining interval found either by elevating or depressing the telescope by a fine-motion screw, or by moving an optical device which causes the image of the rod to be raised or lowered in the telescope field. The position of the cross wire is thus readily found to 0.001 ft.

Object entry information: This instrument is a closed cistern mercury barometer of the type common in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; it is specially adapted for portability and thus capable of employment in measuring altitudes. When it is being transported, the mercury can be forced up so as to fill the tube completely by turning an adjusting screw, which depresses the flexible leather base of the cistern. The aperture in the wooden case, used for reading the height of the mercury and the temperature, can also be closed by a rotating brass sheath. The barometer is graduated in inches, and reads by a vernier index, operated by a rack and pinion mechanism, to 0.002 in. A thermometer, provided with Centigrade and Fahrenheit scales, is placed near the top of the instrument. A suspension ring is fixed at the top, and is covered by a ferrule when the instrument is being carried. A screw cap at the bottom likewise serves to enclose the adjusting screw which operates on the cistern. The wooden case which encloses the lower part of the tube is graduated in inches, so that the instrument can serve as a rough measuring rod.

Object entry information: The Gay-Lussac syphon-tube mercury barometer, in which both the long and short tubes are closed completely at the end, but a small aperture in the side of the short tube permits the air to enter whilst preventing the mercury escaping, was essentially a portable instrument, and was, therefore, often used for measuring altitudes prior to the invention of the aneroid. The instrument exhibited is of this type, and was constructed probably about 1840. The barometer tube is enclosed in a brass case, at the ends of which are cork cushions. Scales graduated directly to 0·02 in. and read by movable verniers to 0·001 in. are engraved upon the case opposite the ends of the mercury. Each vernier has an index which can be set level with the top of the mercury column. The difference between the two readings then gives the height of the barometer. A thermometer, with Centigrade and Fahrenheit graduations, is fixed near the centre of the tube. This instrument is attached by brackets to a wooden stand, and can be set accurately vertical by means of three screws threaded in the lower bracket with their ends pressing against the case of the barometer. For mountain barometers a tripod stand was usually provided.

The zero mark of the altitude scale corresponds to a height of 32 in. in the mercury barometer. The altitude scale has a diam. of 3·5 in., and is graduated every 10 ft., single feet being estimated. The movable glass cover carries an index mark, which is set to the last height read, and a small lens for facilitating reading. The altitude scale is slightly raised on a step so that its inside graduated edge is flush with an aluminium plate fixed to the tip of the hand and provided with a mark. By this arrangement errors due to parallax are avoided. The instrument is compensated for temperature variations.

Object entry information: In aneroid barometers many attempts have been made to provide scales suitable for a very extended range of altitudes. This instrument shows the three concentric circular scale arrangement devised by Major H. S. S. Watkin, by which altitudes from zero to 10,860 ft. can be measured. The zero graduation corresponds to a height of 31 in. in the mercury barometer. Altitudes from zero to 3,440 ft. are marked at 20 ft. intervals on the outermost scale, which has a diameter of 3·6 in. The middle scale, of diam. 2·9 in., records altitudes from 3,440 ft. to 6,860 ft., whilst the innermost scale, of diam. 2·2 in., completes the range to 10,860 ft., every 20 ft. being marked on each scale. The corresponding mercury barometer scales are marked at 0·02 in. intervals from 31 in. to 20 in. To show which scale should be used, an indicator exhibits the number 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to the outer, middle and inner scales respectively.

Object entry information: This resembles the adjacent instrument, made by West, in its general character- istics of compactness and portability, but differs in the arrangement of the cistern. This is of the usual flexible base type, but has a supplementary syphon tube, connected to the cistern by a narrow neck, which can be closed by means of a cock. When the instrument is being used, the cock is opened, and the mercury allowed to attain a fixed height in the syphon tube. This is the zero of the barometer tube scale. For transporting the barometer, the mercury is withdrawn from the syphon tube and the cock closed, after which the flexible base of the cistern is de- pressed by means of the adjusting screw until the mercury completely fills the barometer tube. The barometer tube is graduated in inches, and read to 0·002 in. by a vernier attached to the movable index. A thermometer with Centigrade and Fahrenheit scales is fixed near the top. The window for reading this and the barometer can be closed by means of a rotating brass shutter, and a similar shutter at the bottom of the instrument serves to protect the cistern and syphon tube when required.

Object entry information: The Gay-Lussac syphon-tube mercury barometer, in which both the long and short tubes are closed completely at the end, but a small aperture in the side of the short tube permits the air to enter whilst preventing the mercury escaping, was essentially a portable instrument, and was, therefore, often used for measuring altitudes prior to the invention of the aneroid. The instrument exhibited is of this type, and was constructed probably about 1840. The barometer tube is enclosed in a brass case, at the ends of which are cork cushions.

Object entry information: This instrument was made about 1890, for the use of surveyors in measuring altitudes up to 4,000 ft. The zero mark of the altitude scale corresponds to a height of 32 in. in the mercury barometer. The altitude scale has a diam. of 3·5 in., and is graduated every 10 ft., single feet being estimated. The movable glass cover carries an index mark, which is set to the last height read, and a small lens for facilitating reading. The altitude scale is slightly raised on a step so that its inside graduated edge is flush with an aluminium plate fixed to the tip of the hand and provided with a mark.

The thermometer is suspended with its bulb inside an inner tube connected to the boiler. An outer telescopic tube surrounds this and serves to support the thermometer in addition to forming a steam jacket enclosing the mercury as much as possible. The steam escapes by a hole in the top of this outer tube. In improved hypsometers it is made to retrace its path downwards and escape at the bottom of the steam jacket. With this apparatus altitudes are determined by means of specially prepared tables provided with the instrument, giving the heights above sea level corresponding to a particular temperature at which water boils, and also corrections to be made for latitude, mean temperature of the air, and decrease of gravity with increase of elevation.

Aebutius Faustus, who lived about 100 A.D., is carved a crude representation of the ""groma,"" or surveyor's cross, used by Roman surveyors to set out right angles. The photograph exhibited was taken from this tombstone, which is preserved in the Municipal Museum at Ivrea, North Italy. The carving is a somewhat conventionalized perspective sketch, showing the two crossed arms of the ""stella,"" with only two ""pondera"" (weights) instead of the four usually suspended, one from each end of the ""stella.""

The groma discovered consisted of an iron ""stella"" mounted upon a ""ferramentum,"" also of iron. The ends of the arms of the stella are bent and transfixed by iron bolts, which served to attach a square wooden frame—since perished—to the ""stella,"" and to carry the plumb lines. The length of each side of the wooden framework was 35 cm., and the height of the ""ferramentum,"" exclusive of the upper and lower axis pins, is 35·5 cm. This instrument was, therefore, a small type of groma, and was probably mounted upon a wooden tripod, as shown in the drawing, so that the ""stella"" was at approximately the height of a man from the ground.

Maker/Donor: Made in the Museum
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: During excavations in the Via Abbonanza at Pompeii, in 1912, under the direction of Cav. M. Della Corte, fragments of a Roman groma were discovered. These fragments were sufficiently preserved and complete to enable Dr. Della Corte to reconstruct the original instrument with a certainty not hitherto attained owing to the meagre data available. The instrument exhibited has been constructed in accordance with the measurements and drawings supplied by Dr. Della Corte. As previously reconstructed, the groma consisted of a cross, composed of two equal perpendicular arms intersecting at their centres, mounted upon a supporting staff (ferramentum), upon which the cross could revolve in azimuth: from the ends of the cross were suspended four plummets, through which sights were taken by the surveyor. This reconstruction comprises all the foregoing portions, with the additional modification that the cross is not supported directly upon the staff, but is pivoted upon the outer end of a curved bracket, which is in turn mounted rotatably upon the head of the staff. This arrangement enables the centre of the cross to be set above the mark on a boundary stone, whilst the staff is driven into the ground beside the stone; also, sights could be taken through opposite, not adjacent, plumb lines without interference from the staff. The wooden staff, which is nearly 2 metres long, terminates at its lower end in a fluted iron shoe, and is encircled at its upper extremity by a brass collar, along its upper and lower faces by curved brass strips, and terminating at the staff end in a brass collar and at the cross end in a brass pivot upon which the curved bracket is mounted. The horizontal distance between the cross and bracket pivot centres is 23.4 cm. The cross has a brass centre, and four tapered wooden arms, completely enclosed in thin iron sheeting and reinforced at their intersection by brass angle brackets. The bronze plummets are suspended through holes in the arms at distances of 45 cm. from the centre of the cross. Each plummet resembles its opposite in size and shape but differs from the neighbouring ones. The actual portions discovered included all the metal parts, with a few traces of wood fibres embedded therein. The total height of the instrument is alone considered problematical. (See M. Della Corte's article ""Groma,"" in Monumenti Antichi, Accademia dei Lincei, Vol. XXVIII, 1922.)

Object entry information: The application of the telescope and vertical arc to the alidade of a plane table took place about the same time as the corresponding addition to the theodolite. In this exhibit, made in the late 17th century, a vertical pillar fixed perpendicularly to the alidade carries the vertical semicircle and attached telescope, which can rotate about a horizontal axis in the top of the pillar. A vernier fixed to the pillar records the altitude angle of the line of sight. The alidade is 2 ft. 4 in. long by 1½ in. wide and has one edge bevelled. Over this edge, at the two extremities of the rule, are attached two plain sights, a slit backsight and a vertical wire foresight. A few inches in front of the backsight is the vertical pillar carrying the telescope axis. By means of its milled edge and a wormwheel, the socket of this pillar can be slightly rotated in azimuth, and carries the telescope with it. This serves to adjust the line of sight parallel to the bevelled edge of the rule. The semicircle has a diameter of 5 in. and is graduated in degrees up to 50° of elevation or depression. Its edge is milled and gears with a wormwheel attached to the pillar. The telescope rests in semicircular collars fixed to the diameter of the semi-circle, and is kept in place by hinged straps and screws. It has a rack-focussing objective lens of ¾ in. aperture and a fixed eyepiece tube containing a compound field lens and eyepiece with a fixed cross wire diaphragm between the two lenses of the eyepiece. A spirit level is mounted upon the telescope parallel to its axis. The vernier attached to the pillar is slightly adjustable by means of a slide and lever, and reads the vertical arc to 3 minutes.

Over this edge, at the two extremities of the rule, are attached two plain sights, a slit backsight and a vertical wire foresight. A few inches in front of the backsight is the vertical pillar carrying the telescope axis. By means of its milled edge and a wormwheel, the socket of this pillar can be slightly rotated in azimuth, and carries the telescope with it. This serves to adjust the line of sight parallel to the bevelled edge of the rule. The semicircle has a diameter of 5 in. and is graduated in degrees up to 50° of elevation or depression. Its edge is milled and gears with a wormwheel attached to the pillar. The telescope rests in semicircular collars fixed to the diameter of the semi-circle, and is kept in place by hinged straps and screws. It has a rack-focussing objective lens of ¾ in. aperture and a fixed eyepiece tube containing a compound field lens and eyepiece with a fixed cross wire diaphragm between the two lenses of the eyepiece. A spirit level is mounted upon the telescope parallel to its axis. The vernier attached to the pillar is slightly adjustable by means of a slide and lever, and reads the vertical arc to 3 minutes.

Object entry information: A type of modern plane table outfit with telescopic alidade, suitable for topographical surveys of a comparatively high degree of precision, is here exhibited. Similar outfits have been extensively employed by the topographers of the U.S. Geological Survey. The table is 30 in. by 24 in., and is carefully made in sections to preserve its shape. Brass screw pins fitting into sockets at the corners and middle of the sides are used for fastening the drawing paper to the table, which is slightly recessed at these points to allow the heads of the pins to be flush with the upper surface of the board and thus permit the alidade to slide freely over the pins. The board is connected to the tripod by means of a Johnson quick-levelling socket, which permits it to be easily levelled and rotated in azimuth independently of the tripod. Two butterfly nuts control these movements of levelling and rotation, and, when tightened, clamp the table rigidly to the tripod. This latter has three split legs, 4 ft. long, attached by bolts to the metal tripod head and terminating in metal shoes. Any point on the sketch can be set vertically above the corresponding station point, after the instrument is levelled, by means of the wooden plumbing arm which consists of two pieces so jointed and marked at the joint that, when the upper piece is set flat on the table, with its point over the point on the sketch, and the joint clamped with its two marks coincident, the metal hook at the end of the second arm lies vertically beneath the point. The plumb-bob is suspended from this hook and the table moved until it lies over the station point. A flat 4-in. square metal plate, upon which are mounted two mutually perpendicular spirit levels and a central compass box with a 3-in. needle and ring divided in degrees, is used for levelling and orienting the table. The alidade consists of a flat brass ruler 20 in. long by 4 in. wide, having one edge bevelled and a central pillar projecting vertically from its upper face and supporting the telescope and attached vertical circle, and the fixed vernier for reading this latter. The vertical circle has a diameter of 4.5 in., and is divided on silver to half degrees, read by the vernier to single minutes. It is fixed with the telescope to the horizontal axis, which can rotate within a socket fixed to the vertical pillar. A tangent clamp and slow motion screw is fitted to this axis and connected to the vernier. The telescope is of the pattern usually fixed to 5-in. transit theodolites. It has a rack-focussing objective lens of 1.2 in. aperture and 8 in. focal length, and a rack-focussing eyepiece magnifying 20 diameters. The fixed diaphragm has two horizontal stadia wires as well as the usual cross wires.

Object entry information: The “Vielmesser” or Polymeter, invented by R. Jähns in 1873, is an early example of a plane table alidade adapted to measure the distance, altitude, and azimuth of a point simultaneously. It is mounted upon a horizontal plane table, and used in conjunction with a tacheometric staff of constant interval, set vertically at the distant station.
The alidade consists of a T-shaped base piece, mounted on three levelling screws and provided with two spirit levels. A vertical arm projecting from the base piece carries two metal rulers, which can be rotated independently about a common horizontal axis in the vertical arm by means of quick and slow motion screws. The axis is perpendicular to the longer arm of the base piece, and there is a marking pin attached to the latter vertically beneath the base, so that the alidade can be centred above the observing station point on the plan and rotated as a whole about this point. After this has been done, the inner edges of the two rulers are directed upon the upper and lower reference marks on the distant staff by means of a telescope fixed to the upper ruler. A vertical slide, which carries a distance piece and corresponding wooden scales, is then moved along the alidade until the distance piece—which can move up and down on the slide—fits accurately between the two rulers. There is a lever multiplying device to enable this adjustment to be made with extreme precision, and the final motion of the slide is performed with a slow motion screw. The marking pin attached to the slide vertically beneath the distance piece is now depressed, and the point so defined will correspond to the horizontal projection of the distant staff, both as regards azimuth and distance. The position of the distance piece on the wooden scale on the vertical slide gives the altitude of the staff. The scale of representation in each case is the ratio of the width of the distance piece to the staff interval. Five separate distance pieces are provided, with the corresponding wooden scales, so that a suitable scale of representation can be chosen.

Object entry information: In this alidade devised by the Rev. A. J. Potter for use with a plane table, the usual folding sights are replaced by a single right-angled prism which is mounted at one end of the ruler, with its reflecting base vertical and parallel to the edge of the latter. Any distant object can be viewed directly above the prism, whilst an image of the object can be seen through the prism after refraction on each face and reflection on the base. When the two images thus seen are made to coincide, the edge of the ruler must point at the distant object, and the direction line of the latter can be plotted.
The reflected image is inverted left for right compared with the direct image and is displaced laterally if the ruler is not sighted correctly so that coincidence is readily effected by adjusting the ruler.
The advantage of this type of alidade lies in the rigidity of the sights, absence of illumination, and the increased accuracy of alignment rendered possible by the fact that, for a given angular displacement of the ruler, the displacement of the reflected image is double that of the ruler.
The ruler is 15 in. long, and has its bevelled edge graduated in inches and tenths. A circular bubble level is mounted upon it near the prism.

Object entry information: This consists of a square brass plate with an engraved circle graduated in degrees over which moves an index arm carrying a small compass box. It dates from the 17th century and was probably used for plotting the bearings of objects taken with a circumferentor.
The side of the square plate is 3 in. long, as is also the diameter of the graduated circle. The compass box has a diameter of nearly 1 in. The N.-S. and E.-W. lines are engraved upon the base of the compass. When the needle is set over the N.-S. line, and the index arm which is always parallel to this line is set upon the graduation corresponding to the bearings, two sides of the square plate will be in the proper direction for plotting this bearing. The circle is divided into four quadrants and each quadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°, all the graduations beginning on the same line parallel to two sides of the plate.

The telescopic alidade, which carries the prismatic eyepiece and a vernier underneath this, can be rotated about the vertical axis independently of the compass box, the instrument thus acting as a theodolite—or can be rotated together with the compass ring, in which case it fulfills the functions of a prismatic compass. The compass ring is graduated directly to 20' in a clockwise direction and is read by vernier to single minutes. The instrument is attached to a stand by means of a ball and socket arrangement, and can be levelled independently of the stand by four screws which engage in threads in the socket and press against the vertical axis. There is also a tangent clamp and slow motion screw for rotating the whole instrument in azimuth, whilst a circular rack and pinion inside the compass box serves to rotate the alidade independently. This is actuated by the screw projecting beneath the compass. The telescope carries a small spirit level, and is screwed at the eyepiece end to a brass plate hinged to a sliding piece, whilst it rests at the objective end in a Y-piece fixed to another sliding piece. These two sliding pieces terminate at their lower ends in screws, which work in threaded plates screwed to the compass box. Thus the telescope can be elevated at either end with respect to the compass box and can be adjusted so as to be horizontal. It is focussed by sliding the objective lens.

Object entry information: The quadrant attached to this instrument, which is in other respects similar to the Schmalcalder prismatic compass, enables it to be used for measuring altitudes as well as taking magnetic bearings. The quadrant has separate sights and a small spirit level fixed to a movable radial arm. A mark engraved on the outer end of this arm registers the altitude upon the graduated arc of the quadrant when the arm is horizontal and the sights are directed upon the distant object. The compass ring is 2½ in. in diam. and is fixed to the rotating magnetic needle. It is graduated continuously in half-degrees from 0° to 360°. As the N. point of the needle is attached at the 180° mark of the ring, the correct bearing of the object sighted is read off directly through the prismatic eyepiece attached to the slit back-sight. A small spirit level is fixed to the bottom of the case inside and serves to set the compass horizontal. The altitude quadrant has a radius of 2 in. and is attached to the wire foresight of the compass. It is graduated in degrees from 0° to 90°, the radius corresponding to the former being parallel to the compass plane, and carrying the supplementary sights, a pin-hole back-sight and a cross-wire foresight, for determining altitudes. Mirrors and coloured glasses are attached to the two compass sights for taking bearings on high objects such as the sun.

Object entry information: This is a modern type of compass specially designed for rough surveying and for night marching upon a given bearing, previously set off on the edge of the compass. It has a hair foresight upon the hinged lid, and a slit backsight upon the hinged mounting carrying the prismatic reader. Various marks in luminous paint upon the lid, cover plate and dial of the compass are used in night marching. The compass has a spring damping pin for checking the oscillations of the dial as well as a lifting pin for locking it when not in use. The luminous marks on the lid are at the extremities of the hair foresight. The glass cover plate of the compass box also has a luminous mark and can be independently rotated so as to set this mark at any angle to the sight line. The angle so set is measured by means of an index mark on the cover in conjunction with the graduated edge of the compass box. This is set to the bearing upon which it is desired to march, and the cover plate locked by means of a spring catch which engages in the milled edge of the plate. The dial of the compass, which is fixed to the magnetic needle and pivoted so as to rotate freely, has a luminous arrow marked above the north pole of the magnet. When the compass is turned until the luminous mark on the cover plate lies above the luminous arrow on the dial, the luminous marks at the extremity of the hair line on the lid point in the direction it is desired to march. For surveying purposes the compass dial is graduated in degrees round its edge, the numbers being inverted so as to appear upright when seen through the prism, and so arranged that the correct bearing of the line of sight is read directly through the prism. There is a supplementary set of numbered graduations every 5° for direct reading without using the prism. A ring is hinged to the box to steady it when taking bearings, and a lever on the lid automatically actuates the lifting pin when the lid is closed. The compass has a diameter of 2 in.

Object entry information: This instrument combines the advantages of prismatic reading with the rapid and accurate setting afforded by nearly floating the compass card in a liquid, which reduces the friction of the pivot and rapidly damps the motion of the card. The dial can be illuminated for night reading by means of an electric bulb fixed beneath the transparent base of the compass box. A socket attached to the base enables the compass to be mounted upon the tripod exhibited with it. The compass card has a diameter of 2·5 in. and is graduated in degrees, read by an internal index point mounted beneath the centre of the prismatic reader. The card carries two cylindrical magnetic needles fixed below it with their axes parallel, and has a central buoyant chamber resting upon the pivot. The card, needles and pivot are enclosed in a watertight chamber filled with a mixture of water and alcohol, which has a low freezing point. The card just rests upon the pivot, without pressing much on it, so that there is little frictional resistance to its rotation, and its motion is nearly ""critically damped"" by the liquid so that it takes up its new setting after rotation within a few seconds.

The luminous marks on the lid are at the extremities of the hair foresight. The glass cover plate of the compass box also has a luminous mark and can be independently rotated so as to set this mark at any angle to the sight line. The angle so set is measured by means of an index mark on the cover in conjunction with the graduated edge of the compass box. This is set to the bearing upon which it is desired to march, and the cover plate locked by means of a spring catch which engages in the milled edge of the plate. The dial of the compass, which is fixed to the magnetic needle and pivoted so as to rotate freely, has a luminous arrow marked above the north pole of the magnet. When the compass is turned until the luminous mark on the cover plate lies above the luminous arrow on the dial, the luminous marks at the extremity of the hair line on the lid point in the direction it is desired to march. For surveying purposes the compass dial is graduated in degrees round its edge, the numbers being inverted so as to appear upright when seen through the prism, and so arranged that the correct bearing of the line of sight is read directly through the prism.

Each instrument consists of two graduated aluminium rings separately mounted upon pivots along the axis of a single cylindrical metal box, which is closed by glass faces. A magnetic needle is fixed to one ring, which acts as a compass to determine azimuths, whilst the other ring is loaded at one point and serves as a plummet clinometer for measuring altitude angles. When not in use, each ring can be lifted from its pivots and clamped by means of a lever actuated by a sliding knob. In one instrument the graduated edges of the rings are read by means of two small telescopes, one for each ring, mounted on the metal box; a thin wire is stretched across the box between the telescopes and the rings and defines the index line, or line of sight. In the other instrument, a single telescope can be fitted so as to read either ring alternately, and also to sight upon a distant object. This telescope has a single objective lens and a dual eyepiece, comprising a lens for sighting on the distant object and a prism for reading the graduations upon the upper face of the compass or clinometer ring. In both instruments the rings are graduated in degrees, and a flat footing is attached to the box so that it can be placed upon any surface of which the inclination is to be measured.

A compass is attached to the frame for orienting the instrument, and the whole is attached to a stand by means of a double-knuckled joint, permitting it to be set in any plane. It can also rotate as a whole in that plane. The semicircle has one fixed and one movable alidade, and is 5 in. in diam. It is graduated in degrees, and has a diagonal scale enabling it to read to 5′. This is particularly interesting as showing that the much simpler vernier system was not yet in general use, although invented over 30 years previously. The compass ring has a diameter of 1 1/4 in. and is graduated in degrees. On the back of the plate carrying it is a simple quadrant pendulum clinometer, also graduated in degrees, and provided with “Umbra Versa” and “Umbra Recta” scales for measuring heights. The clinometer is attached to an alidade, which is connected to the semicircle by a spring clip and can be disconnected for taking altitudes.

Each circle is divided into octants and the divisions of each octant numbered in the clockwise sense from 0 to 45 on the outer circle and from 0 to 40 on the inner. The outer octants are successively designated by the letters T, G, L, S, O, A, P, M, which are the initial letters of the old Italian names for the compass points. The inner octants each commence at the central points of the outer ones, and are named Septentrio, Aquilo, Solanus, Eurus, Auster, Africus, Favonius, and Chaurus respectively, which are the old Latin titles for the winds corresponding to the cardinal points. The central index arm has bevelled edges at each extremity for reading the divisions. The alidade is about 9 in. long and has folding combined back and foresights at each end. It rotates with the index arm about the axis of the circle. The compass box, fixed to the circle above the index arm, has its base divided into octants, but no subdivisions.

Object entry information: This instrument is a combined graphometer, or surveying semicircle, and clinometer. The graduated semicircle can be detached from the frame and used as a protractor for plotting the angles in the field. A compass is attached to the frame for orienting the instrument, and the whole is attached to a stand by means of a double-knuckled joint, permitting it to be set in any plane. It can also rotate as a whole in that plane. The semicircle has one fixed and one movable alidade, and is 5 in. in diam. It is graduated in degrees, and has a diagonal scale enabling it to read to 5′. This is particularly interesting as showing that the much simpler vernier system was not yet in general use, although invented over 30 years previously. The compass ring has a diameter of 1 1/4 in. and is graduated in degrees. On the back of the plate carrying it is a simple quadrant pendulum clinometer, also graduated in degrees, and provided with “Umbra Versa” and “Umbra Recta” scales for measuring heights. The clinometer is attached to an alidade, which is connected to the semicircle by a spring clip and can be disconnected for taking altitudes.

Each sight has a vertical slit, a small aperture, and a pair of thin cross-pieces intersecting at the aperture and forming cross-wire foresights. The alidade, pivoted to rotate about the centre of the circle, has a similar pair of sights at the extremities of its index arm, and these have bevelled edges for reading the circle directly. The double vernier plate is screwed to the alidade at right angles to its direction of sight. Each vernier extends over 61° of the circle, and is divided into 60 parts. There are two vernier plates provided, the one fixed to the alidade having engraved upon it the various numbers of foreign feet equal to 1,000 Roman feet. The other vernier plate can be sub stituted for this one if required. The circle graduations have three sets of numbers, one consecutively from 0° to 360° in the clockwise sense, the other two by quadrants having the zero points beneath each of the fixed sights. Scales of sines, tangents and sides of inscribed polygons are also engraved on the circle, as well as various scales of length on its cross-bars. On the back of the circle are engraved other scales used in artillery and fortification work with the Latin inscription "" Bonifacius March"" Rangonus Faciebat jussit Mutinae Anno Domini, 1676"".
A suspension shackle is fixed to the top of the circle for setting it in a vertical plane, and a socket is provided for mounting it horizontally upon a stand.

Combined slit and wire sights are fixed at opposite ends of the diameter of the semicircle, and their orientation determined by means of the compass. A similar pair of sights is attached to the alidade, which rotates about the centre of the semicircle, and has bevelled verniers at each end. The axis of the semicircle terminates below in a spherical ball and socket arrangement for mounting the instrument on a tripod and setting its semicircle in any plane.

The vertical arc, reading angles up to 70° of elevation or depression, has a radius of 2 in. and is similarly graduated and read by a single vernier centrally placed on the horizontal vernier plate. Both circles have toothed edges, in which engage pinion wheels, the motion of rotation being effected by turning these pinions. The telescope is attached above the vertical arc by screw bearings which permit it to be adjusted to sight horizontally when the vertical arc reads zero. A small spirit level fixed above the telescope, and a smaller one rigidly joined to the vertical arc enable this adjustment to be effected. The horizontal axis of rotation of the vertical arc and telescope rests on standards projecting from the central plate carrying the three horizontal vernier arms. To one of these is attached a clamp and screw which regulates the friction between the movable vernier plate and the fixed horizontal circle. In another vernier arm is fixed the axis of rotation of the pinion wheel which engages in the teeth of the horizontal circle. Beneath the horizontal circle is screwed a compass box of 4 in. diameter.

Object entry information: read by three symmetrically placed verniers to 6'. The vertical arc, reading angles up to 70° of elevation or depression, has a radius of 2 in. and is similarly graduated and read by a single vernier centrally placed on the horizontal vernier plate. Both circles have toothed edges, in which engage pinion wheels, the motion of rotation being effected by turning these pinions. The telescope is attached above the vertical arc by screw bearings which permit it to be adjusted to sight horizontally when the vertical arc reads zero. A small spirit level fixed above the telescope, and a smaller one rigidly joined to the vertical arc enable this adjustment to be effected. The horizontal axis of rotation of the vertical arc and telescope rests on standards projecting from the central plate carrying the three horizontal vernier arms. To one of these is attached a clamp and screw which regulates the friction between the movable vernier plate and the fixed horizontal circle. In another vernier arm is fixed the axis of rotation of the pinion wheel which engages in the teeth of the horizontal circle. Beneath the horizontal circle is screwed a compass box of 4 in. diameter. The compass ring is not graduated, but has index marks beneath the o° and the 180° graduations of the horizontal circle. This enables the instrument to be oriented. The conical socket for attaching the theodolite to a staff, or to a levelling device consisting of two parallel plates and four levelling screws, is fixed beneath the compass box. The telescope has a fixed objective of $\frac{3}{4}$-in. aperture, and a sliding Huygens ocular, with a simple fixed cross-wire diaphragm.

Object entry information: The Everest pattern theodolite, although not possessing the advantage of a transit instrument, has been much used by the British and Indian Survey departments since its inception, due to Sir George (then Captain) Everest, about the year 1835. The one exhibited is a late 19th-century 5-in. model, the horizontal circle and vertical arcs being graduated to 20' and read by two opposing verniers to 30''. In the Everest type of theodolite two opposing vertical arcs are used instead of a complete vertical circle, and the horizontal axis to which the telescope and arcs are fixed, is mounted upon two short standards projecting from a central pillar, supported on the horizontal vernier plate. The vernier bracket and attached spirit level are mounted on the axis, and are clamped to one standard by opposing screws. Two perpendicular spirit levels are likewise mounted on the horizontal vernier plate. The horizontal circle has a bevelled graduated edge and a separate mounting on the vertical axis cone. Thus the vernier plate and circle have independent motions, controlled by clamps and tangent screws, for repeating azimuth angles. All verniers are provided with reading microscopes. The instrument has a tribrach mounting, the feet of the three levelling screws resting in grooves in a trivet plate and being locked therein by a spring-controlled locking plate—also a feature of the original Everest design. The telescope has a rack-focussing objective of 1·2-in. aperture and 9-in. focal length, and a slide-focussing Ramsden eyepiece. Owing to the low standards, angles of elevation beyond 30° and of depression beyond 45° cannot be measured, as the telescope then fouls the horizontal plates. The vertical arcs consequently only extend about 50° on each side of the horizontal zeros.

Object entry information: The introduction of the transit principle into medium and small-sized theodolites in England took place in the early part of the 19th century. This exhibit is an early example of such a theodolite. Below the horizontal circle it resembles Ramsden's Y-theodolite, but the upper part has standards sufficiently high to permit the telescope to transit at either end. Both horizontal and vertical circles are 6 in. diam., divided on silver to 10′ and read by opposing verniers to 10″. The vernier plate and horizontal circle have independent axes of rotation for repeating angles, and are bevelled at the graduations to facilitate reading. Reading microscopes are provided for both circles, and also tangent clamps and slow-motion screws, as well as a similar clamp and screw connecting the vernier plate to the horizontal circle. The axis of this circle rests in a conical socket attached to the upper of two parallel levelling plates, connected by four screws and a ball and socket joint. The vernier plate carries a single spirit level, parallel to the transit axis, and a central circular compass box, with a 3½-in. stepped ring graduated in degrees. The needle, of rectangular section with its longer side vertical, is provided with a lifting lever for clamping it. The vertical circle is attached to the telescope and transit axis, and is read by horizontal verniers on a standard. This bracket carries the clamp and tangent screw. The other standard carries a spirit level perpendicular to the transit axis. The telescope, fixed in the centre of the transit axis, has a rack-focussing objective of 1⋅5-in. aperture and 10-in. focal length, a fixed diaphragm having one vertical and three equidistant horizontal wires, and a slide-focussing Ramsden eyepiece. A sensitive spirit level is mounted parallel to the axis of the telescope.

Object entry information: In this instrument, made in the early part of the 19th century, the 8½-in. horizontal and the 7¼-in. vertical circles are graduated every 10′ and read by vernier to 10″. The vertical circle and telescope are rigidly joined to the transit axis and rotate with it, the verniers being fixed to one standard. The horizontal circle and vernier plate can rotate independently about the vertical axis, for repeating azimuth angles. The three footscrews for levelling the instrument are fixed to the base circle of a framed stand having a central conical socket, into which fits the hollow conical axis attached beneath the horizontal circle. The axis of the vernier plate fits within this and is kept in position by a screw and washer fitted in its lower end and abutting against the socket in the stand. The vernier plate carries three symmetrically placed vernier arms, with reading microscopes suspended above their verniers, and is provided with a sensitive spirit level, with its axis perpendicular to the transit axis. The standards supporting the transit axis project from the vernier plate, and have Y-s at their upper ends, one of which is adjustable. The axis is kept in position in these Y-s by metal straps; it is hollow, and permits the telescope to be illuminated by means of a lamp supported by a bracket fixed to one standard. The vernier bracket for reading the vertical circle carries a spirit level parallel to its two vernier arms, for setting their zeros. It has a projecting piece which fits between screws fixed to the standard, and keeps the verniers stationary when the telescope and circle rotate.

Object entry information: The horizontal circle in this instrument, which was made about 1875, has a separate axis with clamps and tangent screw for repeating angles, and is covered by a metal plate attached to the vernier plate. It has a diameter of 14 cm. and is graduated every 20' and read by opposing verniers and reading microscopes to 20"". The reversible level fixed to the telescope has its upper and lower faces used before and after this is transited. The circular metal footplates attached to the extremities of the footscrews by ball and socket joints are peculiar to German instruments. They allow the theodolite to be moved over the surface of the tripod head for centring, which movement is permitted by the special arrangement for connecting the instrument and tripod. The vertical circle has a diameter of 12 cm. and is graduated in half-degrees and read by a single vernier to minutes. It is rigidly fixed to the transit axis and telescope. This has a fixed objective of 22-cm. focal length and 3-cm. aperture, and a rack-focussing eyepiece tube, carrying the fixed diaphragm and a slide-focussing inverting eyepiece. The reversible level is attached by adjustable screws parallel to the axis of the telescope. Any error in adjustment between the level and telescope is automatically corrected by transiting the telescope and again levelling it after rotation horizontally through 180°. An axis clamp and

Object entry information: itself be clamped to the vertical axis by a tangent screw. There are two verniers, with reading microscopes, rigidly attached to the telescope, Upon the same axis, but capable of independent rotation, are the vertical circle and a counterpoise circle; the axis also carries a spirit level fixed horizontally on adjustable bearings. The vertical circle is clamped by a screw attached to the counterpoise, a slow-motion screw being provided. A similar clamp and screw connect the vertical circle and the vernier bracket. The telescope has a rack-focussing objective of aperture 1.1 in. and focal length 9.5 in. The diaphragm is fixed in the telescope tube and has two wires forming an acute angled cross instead of the usual vertical wire, together with a single horizontal wire. Three eyepieces are provided, all inverting: one is diagonal for taking steep sights, whilst the other two have different magnifications. The instrument has a tribrach mounting, with three footscrews set in a locking plate of the Everest pattern. The telescope transits at the objective end. A supplementary telescope is provided and can be fixed near the edge of the horizontal circle. It is of equal dimensions with the main telescope, and is used for keeping the back station in view, and also as a test of the fixity of the horizontal circle when the upper part is rotated.

Date of creation: probably constructed in the middle of the 19th century
Object entry information: This is a highly compact transit theodolite, with vertical and horizontal circles of diameter 3.5 in., graduated in half-degrees and read by vernier to single minutes. It rests on three levelling screws, which can be fitted within three V-shaped notches in the top of the case. The instrument was probably constructed in the middle of the 19th century. The horizontal circle is fixed to the tribrach, which carries a supplementary telescope, tangential to the circle, for keeping the back station in view. A single central standard projects vertically from the horizontal circle, and serves as an axis for the hollow cylinder which carries the vernier bracket for the horizontal axis at its lower extremity, and a bracket to which is fixed the vertical circle at its upper end. The telescope is fixed to an arm carrying opposing verniers for the vertical circle, and can rotate with this arm about a horizontal axis through the top of the standard. A spirit level is attached to the back of the vertical circle, at right angles to the standard. Tangent clamps and slow-motion screws are fixed to the vernier brackets of both circles, and there are magnifying lenses for facilitating the reading of the vernier. There are three verniers to the horizontal circle, symmetrically disposed round its circumference. The vertical circle has two verniers at opposite ends of a diameter. The main and supplementary telescopes are of equal size and power. Their objectives have a focal length of 3.5 in., and a clear aperture of 0.6 in. They slide in the telescope tubes for focussing. The eyepieces are of the Ramsden type. Diaphragms fitted with cross wires are fixed inside the telescope tubes. The one on the main telescope has two vertical wires and one horizontal wire. A diagonal eyepiece is provided for taking steep sights. As the telescope is slightly eccentric to the vertical standard, a counterpoise to balance its weight is fitted on the standard.

Object entry information: This instrument illustrates many of the characteristics of modern American transit theodolites of the type used in reconnaissance and engineering surveying. The solar attachment to the telescope for determining meridians and latitudes by observations on the sun is a special feature, whilst the levelling base, with its ""shifting centre"" and four footscrews, is typical of American construction.
The horizontal circle has a diameter of 6·25 in. and is graduated on silver to 30', reading by two opposite verniers to 1'. It is covered by a metal plate attached to the vernier plate and having windows above the verniers. The graduations on the limb are in two sets, one completely round the circle from 0° to 360°, the other in four quadrants from 0° to 90°. The figures are slightly inclined in the direction of increasing numbers. The vernier cover plate carries two spirit levels with their axes respectively parallel and at right angles to the transit axis. A large compass box, with a 5-in. ring graduated in half-degrees, is so mounted on the centre of the plate that its ring can be rotated in its own plane by a rack and pinion arrangement. The pivot of the needle is attached to a large plate, which can be lifted as a whole for clamping the needle. The standards for the transit axis terminate in Y-bearings, one of which is adjustable. The transit axis carries at one end a small spirit level, which can rotate about it, and be clamped in any position to rotate with the axis. At the opposite end is similarly mounted the vertical arc, its vernier being adjustably fixed to the corresponding standard. The arc is graduated every 20' and reads by vernier to 30'; angles of elevation or depression up to 80° can be read. The telescope rigidly fixed to the axis transits at either end. It has an 11 in. objective, of 13/16ths in. aperture, with a rack and pinion focussing movement, and an erecting eyepiece of magnification 26 diam., also rack focussing. Three parallel horizontal and one vertical platinum wires are mounted in the diaphragm, the two outer horizontal ones being for stadia work. A sensitive level, 7½-in. long, with a metal scale for reading the bubble is mounted beneath the telescope and can be adjusted by capstan screws at both ends.
The solar attachment is of the type invented by Burt, and is fixed to the top of the telescope, with its polar axis perpendicular to that of the telescope and the transit axis. This axis, and the hour circle attached to it, can be adjusted on the telescope to ensure perpendicularity. The hour circle is graduated every 5', and has a diameter of 1·5 in. The declination arc, movable about the polar axis, has a radius of 5 in., with a silver limb graduated every 15' from 0° to 33°, and read by a vernier on the sighting arm to 30"". This sighting arm is mounted on the centre of the arc, and can be rotated with respect to it by a fine threaded screw. At each end of the arm is fixed a lens with a pin-hole stop and a silver reflecting plate on which are engraved parallel lines in two perpendicular directions, at a distance apart equal to the diameter of the sun's image. In using this attachment to find the true meridian, the co-latitude of the place is set off on the vertical arc, the declination of the sun and time on the arc, and the hour on its circle, and the telescope is then rotated in azimuth until the sun's image, caused by refraction through the lens of the sighting arm, falls exactly between the lines on the mirror. The telescope and polar axis are then in the meridian.

Object entry information: The precision of small theodolites has been greatly enhanced in recent years by the provision of micrometer microscopes for reading the circles to within a few seconds. The instrument exhibited, salved from a German warship sunk at Scapa, illustrates a type of theodolite of Continental design, with micrometer reading to both circles, the telescope and vertical circle being mounted eccentrically at one end of the transit axis. The horizontal and vertical circles, of diameters 14 cm. and 13 cm. respectively, are graduated on silver to 10' and read by two opposing micrometer microscopes to 2"", the micrometer drums being graduated every 20"", and the tenths estimated. The eccentric arrangement of the telescope has obvious disadvantages, but permits the telescope to transit independently of the height of the standards above the horizontal circle, and also enables longer microscopes to be employed with the vertical circle than is possible when the telescope is above the vertical axis.

A sensitive spirit level is fixed to the vernier bracket, perpendicular to the transit axis. The telescope has a fixed objective of 1.25 in. aperture, and an internal lens, movable for focussing by means of a central screw operating the rack and pinion. This screw is conveniently placed at one end of the transit axis. The eyepiece is inverting, screw focussing and magnifies 20 diam. It can readily be removed to permit access to the diaphragm, which is fixed in the main telescope tube and is of the star pattern, with one horizontal and two equally inclined wires intersecting on the former. The gradienter scale is fixed to the clamping bracket of the vertical circle, the head of the tangent screw having a graduated drum reading hundredths of the scale divisions, each of which is one-hundredth of the distance between the transit axis and the axis of the tangent screw. In using the scale for measuring distances, the altitude introduces a factor depending on the square of its cosine. The instrument has a tribrach mounting with three levelling screws, the feet of which rest in grooves in a trivet stage and are kept fixed by a locking plate. A knurled clamping screw serves to fix this stage to the tripod head, permitting a small centring movement without disturbing the tripod.

Maker/Donor: Made by Thos. Jones. Presented by the Admiralty.
Date of creation: early part of the 19th century
Object entry information: The Dip-Sector was first designed and made by Troughton for measuring the ""dip of the horizon"" from an elevated observing point. The example shown was made in the early part of the 19th century. The graduated sector, index arm, index mirror and horizon mirror are the same as in the sextant, but the telescope has its eyepiece at right angles to its objective, a reflecting mirror being interposed between the two. This enables the observer to measure the zenith angle between the apparent horizon lines to his left and right. By rotating the handle through a half turn, he can measure the corresponding nadir angle. The quarter of the difference between these two readings is the required dip angle between his apparent and true horizons. The index error is eliminated in this method. The sector has a radius of 7 in. and is divided on silver from 5° to 40° every 10' and read by vernier to 10"". The actual angles are only half the graduation angle, as in the sextant, but the angle read is the correct one between the two sight lines. The horizon mirror, fixed to the sector, is partly silvered and partly unsilvered. The index glass, which rotates with the index arm, is wholly silvered, and has a central index. The arm carries the vernier, and can be clamped to the sector at any point, further rotation being effected by a tangent screw. The telescope can be adjusted to vary its lateral distance from the sector by a screw, and the handle can be rotated and clamped in any position parallel to the face of the sector.

Date of creation: 17th-century
Object entry information: This is a 17th-century instrument for measuring angles in either a vertical or a horizontal plane. It consists of a wooden rectangular frame to which can be screwed a brass socket in either of two positions for setting the plane of the rectangle horizontal or vertical. Two adjacent sides of the rectangle have folding brass sights at their corners for setting off right angles. A movable brass index arm, provided with folding sights, is centred on one of the sighted sides of the rectangle and rotates over a brass scale mounted on the other side. This scale is graduated to read tangents, to the nearest tenth. A clamp and screw fixed to the index arm serve to clamp it in any desired position to a brass arc fixed to the rectangle. The outer sight on the arm carries a plumb-line when the rectangle is horizontal. When vertical angles are being measured, the plumb-line is detached and fixed to a screw so that it hangs parallel to the brass scale in the plane of the rectangle.

Object name: TROUGHTON DIP SECTOR.
Maker/Donor: Made by Thos. Jones. Presented by the Admiralty.
Date of creation: early part of the 19th century
Object entry information: The Dip-Sector was first designed and made by Troughton for measuring the ""dip of the horizon"" from an elevated observing point. The example shown was made in the early part of the 19th century. The graduated sector, index arm, index mirror and horizon mirror are the same as in the sextant, but the telescope has its eyepiece at right angles to its objective, a reflecting mirror being interposed between the two. This enables the observer to measure the zenith angle between the apparent horizon lines to his left and right. By rotating the handle through a half turn, he can measure the corresponding nadir angle. The quarter of the difference between these two readings is the required dip angle between his apparent and true horizons. The index error is eliminated in this method. The sector has a radius of 7 in. and is divided on silver from 5° to 40° every 10' and read by vernier to 10"". The actual angles are only half the graduation angle, as in the sextant, but the angle read is the correct one between the two sight lines. The horizon mirror, fixed to the sector, is partly silvered and partly unsilvered. The index glass, which rotates with the index arm, is wholly silvered, and has a central index. The arm carries the vernier, and can be clamped to the sector at any point, further rotation being effected by a tangent screw. The telescope can be adjusted to vary its lateral distance from the sector by a screw, and the handle can be rotated and clamped in any position parallel to the face of the sector.

(See ""Zeitschrift für Vermessungswesen,"" 1902, p. 214-216.) The second microscope, known as a ""Nonien-Mikroskop,"" has a fixed vernier scale marked in its focal plane, and is used for theodolites having 13-cm. circles graduated to 5'. Ten divisions of the vernier scale correspond to nine of the circle, whence the position of the zero vernier line can be read to 30"", or even to 15"" by estimation. Alternate graduations of the vernier scale are numbered consecutively from 0 to 5, and represent minutes. (See ""Zeitschrift für Instrumentenkunde,"" 1912, Part V.)

Object entry information: The main angles of the Prinicipal Triangulation of Great Britain and Ireland were mostly measured with this altazimuth theodolite, or with a very similar one now in the possession of the Royal Society. The latter was made by Ramsden in 1787 and the one here exhibited about 1790; both were in constant use between 1792 and 1862, and several sights were taken with them during the Principal Triangulation at distances exceeding 100 miles. The theodolite here exhibited has a 3-ft. horizontal circle, divided to 10' and read to 1"" by three micrometer microscopes. The circle is mounted upon ten conical radii, which project from the outer conical vertical axis; this revolves upon an inner fixed axis to which the reading microscopes and levelling foot screws are fixed. A flat horizontal bar rigidly mounted across the top of the outer axis supports the telescope axis. Two 10·5-in. vertical circles, divided to 30', and read to 3"" by single microscopes mounted on the telescope axis and supporting bar are made accurately horizontal by means of two spirit levels, one 24 in. and the other 21 in. long.

1925 - geodesy and surveying_page_94.png,218.0,DIAGRAM OF MICROMETER MICROSCOPE. (Ramsden's 3-ft. Theodolite.),Constructed in the Museum.,,"The method of reading a graduated scale by means of a micrometer microscope having at its focal plane a movable cross wire, was first applied to theodolites by Ramsden in the construction of his 3-ft. instruments. The diagram shows the details of his later microscopes, which were added to the original two of his theodolites, and which differ very slightly from those. The microscope has a single objective lens fixed in a tube, which is mounted in the supporting bracket and can be slightly adjusted towards or from the graduated circle of the theodolite. The base of the micrometer box is screwed to the top of this tube and has a smaller one screwed into its top; the latter carries a slide-focussing eyepiece of the usual Ramsden type. The micrometer box contains two adjustable stages having their inner surfaces contiguous and their outer surfaces touching the walls of the box. The lower edge of the aperture of the upper stage has divisions notched in it at intervals of a hundredth of an inch, every fifth notch larger than the rest. The interval between the larger scale divisions is the same as that between adjacent divisions on the graduated circle when the latter interval is magnified by the microscope objective. Thus the interval between consecutive notches is 1′ of arc on the circle. The lower stage has a cross hair attached to its inner face, and can be moved as a whole across the notched scale by rotating the micrometer head; this head is threaded on to a screwed pin fixed to one end of the stage, and is pressed against the micrometer box by a counter helical spring inside the box. The pin has 100 threads per inch, so that the cross hair moves over one division of the notched scale at each revolution of the micrometer head. The periphery of the drum on this head is divided into 60 parts, and its rotation read by the position of a knife edge fixed to the box. Thus a rotation of the drum through one division of its periphery causes the cross hair to travel through 1″ of arc on the circle.

Object entry information: This instrument was ordered in 1858 for use in a projected general survey of Egypt. It has horizontal and vertical circles, each 40-cm. diam., graduated direct on silver to 5', and each read by four micrometer microscopes direct to 2"", by estimation to 0"".
The vertical circle, together with a circle of equal dimensions as a counterpoise, is fixed directly to the horizontal axis of rotation of the telescope. This axis rests in bearings upon two standards which carry, opposite the two ends of the axis, fixed brackets for supporting the circle carrying the microscopes at one end and a counterpoise at the other. The axis of the telescope is pierced by a cylindrical hole for illuminating the interior, and a lamp can be attached to one of the brackets for this purpose. The standards project from a horizontal stage fixed to the alidade platform by adjustable screws, operated by a wormwheel and pinion mechanism. These serve to level the stage more precisely after the alidade has been approximately levelled by the three footscrews attached to the horizontal circle. A striding level fitted parallel to the axis of rotation of the telescope, together with a perpendicular level fixed to the microscope circle, is used for levelling. The alidade platform carries the four microscopes for reading the graduated horizontal scale, and can be rotated in azimuth, carrying the whole upper portion with it. The horizontal circle itself is fixed to the three footscrews, but its graduated circle can be independently rotated for ""repeating"" angles. In addition to the microscopes, there is an index arm with a reading lens for checking the major readings of each circle. Tangent clamps and slow-motion screws are fitted to both the vertical circle and the alidade.
The telescope has an objective of 2-2-in. aperture and 30-in. focal length, and an inverting draw-focussing Ramsden eyepiece, to which is fitted a micrometer stage having one horizontal and five vertical fixed threads, and one vertical thread movable by means of the micrometer screw.

Object entry information: This theodolite was constructed in 1910 for use on the Primary (First Order) Triangulation of the United Kingdom and has already been used to observe the angles of a piece of test triangulation in North-East Scotland in 1911-12, when 29 angles were observed with a mean error of 0.517"" per angle.
It is a transit theodolite with a repeating horizontal circle of 12-in. diam., read by three micrometer microscopes to 1"" and by estimation to 0.1"". A separate pointer microscope serves to check the integral degrees of the reading. The circle is protected from dust by a cover plate provided with apertures for the tubular microscope reflectors which form dustproof connections to the microscopes. The outer vertical axis is rigidly connected to a strong tribrach with its arms with levelling footscrews and strengthened by a strong metal ring, covered with leather, which serves to lift the instrument. The footscrews rest in radial V-shaped notches on a lower tribrach plate which rests upon a strong circular baseplate having a massive curb. The lower tribrach has a central boss projecting through an aperture in the base plate; three radial screws threaded in the curb impinge on this boss and serve to move the whole instrument accurately over the station point. The vertical axis has a central socket in which can be inserted a nadir telescope for this centring operation.
The massive U-shaped standards for supporting the telescope axis of rotation are cast in one piece and attached to the cover plate of the horizontal circle, which also carries two mutually perpendicular spirit levels for setting the plate horizontal. The telescope axis is hollow and thus permits the diaphragm to be illuminated by an electric lamp supported on one standard, the light being reflected down the axis of sight by a central diagonal reflector inside the telescope. The latter has a fixed objective of 3-in. aperture and 24-in. focal length and a rack-focussing micrometer eyepiece tube in which various inverting eyepieces of powers 72, 50 and 30 diam. can be fitted. A 6-in. vertical circle, reading by two fixed verniers to 1' is attached to the telescope and rotates with it; the vernier bracket, which carries a sensitive spirit level parallel to the telescope axis, is clamped to one standard. A very sensitive striding level is mounted on the telescope axis pivots; its bubble moves about 0.1 in. per 1"" difference of elevation.
For testing the cylindricity of the telescope axis, an arrangement designed by Sir David Gill is provided (see “Report of Geodetic Survey of South Africa,” 1896, p. 123). Its micrometer drum reads to 0.00001 in. All the circles are fitted with clamps and tangent screws for slow motion.

Maker/Donor: Troughton
Date of creation: Beginning of the 19th century
Object entry information: This portable sector was made at the beginning of the 19th century for use in America and was afterwards transferred to Copenhagen. The main telescope for observing stars near the zenith is pivoted horizontally near its objective end to the top of a vertical hollow brass cylinder, which carries at its lower end the fixed graduated sector over which the eyepiece of the telescope rotates. Two micrometer microscopes fixed to the telescope serve to read its inclination to the vertical upon separate scales engraved on the sector. The scales, each of which covers about 15° and is divided to 3', start at opposite ends of the sector and overlap about 5° in the centre. A third scale, continuous across the whole sector, is read by an index and serves as a check. The telescope has an objective of 2.5-in. aperture and 45-in. focal length. Its motion over the sector is controlled by a clamp and tangent screw. The base of the vertical cylinder is connected to a horizontal circle by six vertical pillars and can rotate with this circle about a vertical axis coincident with the cylinder axis. A long plummet suspended within the cylinder along its axis rests in a water vessel, inside the pillars, and serves to set the axis vertical. Its position is observed by two perpendicular microscopes fixed in the cylinder below the graduated sector. A small telescope pivoted to the cylinder is used to observe circumpolar stars for setting the sector in the meridian. The horizontal circle has a diameter of 9 in. and is divided to 10"". The vertical axis revolves inside a conical socket fixed to the tribrach, which carries three verniers for reading the circle to 10"". The three levelling foot screws of the tribrach rest on the top plate of a strong mahogany tripod. A small spirit level is mounted on the cylinder for rough levelling, and an adjustable counterpoise balances the telescope. (See Pearson's Astronomy, 1829, Vol. II, p. 546.)

Date of creation: N/A (The original instrument was supplied to the Survey of India in 1909.)
Object entry information: This photograph illustrates a 3-in. portable zenith telescope for determining latitudes by the Talcott method. The original instrument was supplied to the Survey of India in 1909, and is a typical example of the modern zenith instrument for geodetic work. The telescope, of 3-in. aperture and about 42-in. focal length, is mounted at one end of the horizontal axis by means of a centrepiece, which also carries the Talcott level frame. The latter has two chambered levels, running 0·1 in. to 2"" of arc, enclosed in special sealed cases lined with thermal insulating material, and is provided with a long sensitive clamp and slow motion screw permitting an accurate adjustment in altitude. The horizontal axis has a weight relieving spring and ball race at the telescope end and a counterpoise at the other end; it is hollow to permit illumination of the telescope field by means of an oil or electric lamp. The telescope has a steel micrometer eyepiece, giving a value of about 30"" to one revolution of the micrometer screw. A 7-in. setting circle, divided on silver to 30' and reading by vernier to 1', is mounted on the telescope near the eyepiece end. A 10 in. diam. horizontal circle, divided on silver to 30' and read by vernier to 1', is mounted on the tribrach base, which is provided with three levelling foot-screws. A clamp and slow motion screw controls the vertical axis motion, and two adjustable stops are provided to enable the telescope to be rapidly rotated in azimuth through 180°. A striding level is mounted above the horizontal axis of the instrument.

Object name: PORTABLE TRANSIT.
Maker/Donor: Made by Brauer, Pulkowa Observatory. Lent by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Plate VI, Fig. 2, p. 86.
Date of creation: Used about 1850
Object entry information: A transit of this type was used about 1850 by F. G. Struve in his measurement of an arc of the 52nd parallel from Haverfordwest to Eastern Russia. The telescope has a 2·7 in. objective and is ""broken"" where it meets the hollow transit axis, a diagonal prism being here interposed to deflect the light into the eyepiece tube at one end of this axis. The diaphragm of the Ramsden eyepiece, which has a pair of movable wires actuated by a micrometer screw in addition to an adjustable reticule, is illuminated by a lamp mounted at the other end of the transit axis. A vertical circle of 11 in. diam., divided on silver to 10', is fixed to the transit axis near the eyepiece, and is read by an index on the adjacent standard. The steel pivots of the transit axis rest on high standards projecting from the levelling platform, which is supported on the wooden tripod stand by three levelling screws, having a point, line and plane contact respectively with the bearing plates. Two small bubble-levels are used to set the base horizontal by means of the foot-screws, and the transit axis is finally adjusted horizontal by a sensitive hanging level.

Maker/Donor: Made by A. Jobin, Paris. Plate VII, Fig. 1, p. 90.
Date of creation: about the year 1900
Object entry information: This instrument, also known as a ""Prismatic Astrolabe,"" was designed by MM. Claude and Driencourt about the year 1900, and is used for the astronomical determination of latitude, local time and azimuth. It acts on the principle of determining the exact moment at which a known star crosses a horizontal circle of constant angle, namely 60°. The instrument exhibited is the ""geodetic"" model of the firm, and has a telescope of aperture 40 mm. and magnification 75 diam. Latitudes can be determined with it to 0.4"" and time to 0.04/sin $\lambda$ sec., where $\lambda$ is the co-latitude of the observing station. The telescope can rotate in azimuth upon one end of a horizontal plate, which carries a mercury artificial horizon at its other end and can itself rotate above the graduated horizontal circle of the instrument. This circle is divided in degrees, serving any particular star. An equilateral glass prism of sides and height 45 mm. is mounted in front of the objective lens of the telescope, with its base vertical and apex edge horizontal. When the star is nearly at an altitude of 60°, two images are seen of it in the telescope, one by light refracted through the prism and telescope, and the other by light reflected from the mercury horizon before refraction in the prism. At the precise moment that the star crosses the 60° horizontal circle, the two images meet on the same horizontal line of the telescope graticule. By a series of similar observations of the times of crossing of known stars, both latitude and local time can be ascertained from tables. (See ""Handbook of the Prismatic Astrolabe,"" by J. Ball and H. Knox-Shaw, 1919.)

Date of creation: mid-19th-century dial
Object entry information: The plain mine surveyor's dial is very similar to the old circumferentor and has been much employed in England owing to its adaptability to surveying in low galleries and suitability for traversing. The instrument exhibited is a mid-19th-century dial, with a 5-in. compass ring graduated in degrees and a vernier fixed to the movable alidade reading to 3'. The compass ring and base are mounted upon an axial socket perpendicular to their planes and can be rotated about the central axis which fits in this socket and terminates in a spherical ball. This latter is gripped by another socket and can be clamped in any desired position so that the plane of the compass faces any direction. A slit in the socket allows the compass to take up a vertical position for measuring altitude angles. When measuring azimuth angles, the plane of the compass is levelled by means of a pair of perpendicular tube spirit levels fixed to the alidade. This is attached to the compass case, and carries combined back-sights and foresights at each end. The alidade and compass case, with the internal vernier scale, can be rotated independently of the compass ring and angles measured as in a theodolite, or the case can be clamped to the compass ring and the two rotated together about the axis of the latter for taking magnetic bearings, as in the ordinary compass. In the former case, the alidade is fitted with a tangent screw for slow-motion adjustment. The sights are 6 in. high and fixed at a distance of 1 ft. apart on the alidade. Each sight has both a slit and a pin-hole backsight and a long single-wire and a cross-wire foresight. The aperture and cross-wire sights are for use in measuring altitude angles. For this purpose the compass needle is locked by operating the lifting lever, the plane of the compass is set vertical, and the lid is placed in position on the box, and a plumb-line suspended from a stud in this lid.

The compass ring can rotate inside the box about the vertical axis, for measuring azimuth angles independently of the needle, or can be clamped to the box for taking magnetic bearings.
The compass ring has an outside diameter of 5 in. graduated in degrees for reading with the vernier, which is fixed to the box above one pivot of the rocking circle. The graduations extend to the inner edge of the ring, which has a diameter of 4 $\frac{1}{2}$ in. and is read by the needle. The base of the compass is also graduated every 10° and the cardinal points are marked on it. It also carries two spirit levels with their axes mutually perpendicular.
The vertical semicircle has a diameter of 5 in. and is graduated in degrees, with an inner scale of hypotenusal increments. The rocking circle has projecting lugs at right angles to its axis of rotation. The plain sights or standards for the telescope can be fixed to these lugs. The plain sights are 6 in. high and have both slits and wires for taking azimuth angles either way.

Object entry information: Theodolites with eccentrically mounted telescopes and vertical circles, which can be transited without requiring high standards projecting from the horizontal vernier plate, have been very generally employed by Continental mine surveyors owing to their suitability for work in low galleries. The example exhibited is of this type, the transit axis being mounted just above the vernier plate and carrying a telescope and vertical circle at one end, just clear of the horizontal circle.
Both circles are of 3 in. diam., graduated every 30ʹ and read to 1ʹ by opposing verniers. A 3-in. compass, mounted upon a large circular spirit level, is fixed to the upper part above the transit axis.
The horizontal circle and vernier plate have independent vertical axes of rotation for repeating azimuth angles, with separate clamps and tangent screws.
The axial socket of the circle carries a tribrach fitted with levelling footscrews, as is commonly the case in German instruments of this period—the latter half of the 19th century. The foot-plates rested on the tripod head, which was connected to the instrument by a central plunger screw. On loosening this, the theodolite could be accurately centred without moving the tripod.
A stout tubular supporting piece projects centrally above the vernier plate and carries the socket for the transit axis, and the ring for the compass and spirit level. The vertical circle is fixed to the transit axis socket and the telescope to an inner rotating vernier plate, which also carries a tangent clamp and slow-motion screw fitting. A spirit level is mounted on the telescope, parallel to the line of sight. The telescope has a fixed objective of $\frac{7}{8}$-in. aperture and a rack-focussing eyepiece tube carrying a fixed Huygens ocular, with a pair of cross wires fixed between the two lenses. A diagonal reflecting prism is screwed to the eyepiece for convenience in sighting. The compass ring is graduated in half-degrees, and a lifting lever is provided for clamping the needle against the cover, the glass cover of the circular spirit level forms the base of the compass box.

Object entry information: The chief feature of this mining dial, which is a modern example of the type invented by John Hedley in 1830, is the use of a rocking circle, pivoted externally to the compass box, to carry either plain sights or a telescope. This arrangement permits a fairly steep vertical angle to be measured, the angle being read by an index revolving with the rocking circle over a graduated semicircle fixed to the compass box. The compass ring can rotate inside the box about the vertical axis, for measuring azimuth angles independently of the needle, or can be clamped to the box for taking magnetic bearings.
The compass ring has an outside diameter of 5 in. graduated in degrees for reading with the vernier, which is fixed to the box above one pivot of the rocking circle. The graduations extend to the inner edge of the ring, which has a diameter of 4 $\frac{1}{2}$ in. and is read by the needle. The base of the compass is also graduated every 10° and the cardinal points are marked on it. It also carries two spirit levels with their axes mutually perpendicular.
The vertical semicircle has a diameter of 5 in. and is graduated in degrees, with an inner scale of hypotenusal increments. The rocking circle has projecting lugs at right angles to its axis of rotation. The plain sights or standards for the telescope can be fixed to these lugs. The plain sights are 6 in. high and have both slits and wires for taking azimuth angles either way. In addition, one sight has a pin-hole aperture and the other a pair of cross wires for measuring vertical angles.
The telescope has a rack-focussing objective, of focal length 9 $\frac{1}{2}$ in. and aperture 1 in., a simple cross-wire diaphragm, and a slide-focussing inverting eyepiece.

Object entry information: parts from the dust and dirt inseparable from mine surveying, and the provision of means for taking sights at very short ranges and at extreme vertical angles.
The 4·5-in. horizontal and 4-in. vertical circles are graduated directly to 20′ and read by two opposing verniers and reading microscopes to 30″. Both circles are encased in metal, the verniers being protected by hinged glass covers, which can be raised for cleaning. The circles and the horizontal vernier plate have independent motions, and are provided with clamping and slow-motion screws, the two screws to each circle being distinguished by differently shaped heads. All the verniers have ground glass reflectors.
The main telescope, of 6·5-in. focal length and 1·1-in. aperture, transits at either end, and has an internal focussing lens actuated by a screw at one end of the transit axis. This arrangement permits the telescope tube to be rendered dustproof, and to be focussed down to 5 ft. An objective focussing auxiliary telescope, of 5-in. focal length and 0·9-in. aperture, can be fitted either on top or at the side of the main telescope, for use in taking steep sights, and is balanced by a counterpoise. Both telescopes and reading microscopes have screw-focussing inverting eyepieces. An additional diagonal erecting eyepiece is provided for use with either telescope. The diaphragm of the main telescope is of the web type, with 1 : 100 horizontal stadia lines, and can be readily withdrawn an interchangeable glass diaphragm is also supplied.
The standards supporting the vertical circle and telescope axis are fixed to the vernier plate, which carries a small circular spirit level and a long adjustable tubular one, with its axis parallel to the transit axis. A similar tubular level is mounted upon the telescope, and can be adjusted parallel to its optical axis.
The horizontal circle is attached to a tribrach, in the arms of which three foot-screws are provided with dustproof covers, and their feet are firmly fixed in a trivet stage, which can be screwed to the tripod head but has also three pointed feet for fixing it upon a platform independently of the tripod. The tripod head has a centring arrangement of 2½-in. range, permitting the instrument to be centred over the station point without moving the tripod legs.
A delicate compass of special design is attached to one standard and serves to give a magnetic zero line.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This so-called transit is essentially a combined compass and clinometer designed for filling in the minor details of a survey, more particularly in mine surveying, as the sights can be adjusted to steep slopes without displacing the compass box from the horizontal. The position of the compass needle and the bubble of the clinometer can be read at the same time as the sight is taken by means of the mirror mounted inside the hinged lid of the compass box.
The instrument consists of a circular aluminium compass box, to which are attached on opposite sides a hinged lid and a hinged slit and aperture backsight. The inner face of the lid is a mirror and has a diametral line engraved upon it, which bisects an aperture pierced in the lid near the hinge ; this aperture serves as foresight for viewing any object, though the reflection of the slit of the backsight in the mirror, together with the line engraved thereon, serve to determine the exact bisection of the object viewed. In taking sights, the lid is inclined at an angle of 45° to the face of the compass, so that a reflected image of the compass ring and clinometer is seen.
The compass has a stepped ring, about 2½-in. diam., with its edge graduated in degrees. An edge-bar needle is pivoted at the centre and can be lifted from the pivot by means of a lever, actuated by pressing a button. The act of closing the lid of the compass depresses this button and clamps the needle. The clinometer arrangement is pivoted to the base of the compass below the needle and consists of a rotatable vernier arm upon which is mounted a small bubble level. The arm traverses a graduated arc engraved on the base of the box, and the vernier reads this arc to 10′. The movement of the arc is operated from outside the box by means of a small rotating arm having a milled button at its extremity. Two flats are filed upon the side of the compass box, which is rested on either of these when vertical angles are being measured by means of the clinometer.
The aperture plate of the backsight bracket is separately hinged to this, so that, when the bracket is adjusted to the angle convenient for taking a sight, the aperture plate can remain vertical.

Maker/Donor: Messrs. Cooke, Troughton & Simms, Ltd.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: Many mining surveys, being based upon magnetic bearings, require an accurate determination of the magnetic meridian to serve as a periodical check and to connect them with the surface survey. The ordinary magnetic needle is not sufficiently sensitive to respond to the daily changes in the magnetic meridian, and the instrument exhibited was designed by Mr. T. Lindsay Galloway to enable the meridian to be fixed with the required accuracy. The instrument consists of a tribrach levelling stage, supporting a long cylindrical case within which is suspended an arrangement consisting of a plane mirror and a pendant connected by a fibre of unspun silk. Both mirror and pendant are mounted upon stems to which the ends of the fibre are fixed, and a small bar magnet is attached across the back of the mirror. Either the pendant stem or the mirror stem, or both together, can be clamped to the case by means of adjustable stirrup clamps, and the case can be inverted upon the tribrach levelling stage so that either the pendant or the mirror is uppermost. In using the instrument the case is first set up with the mirror above and the pendant below, and the latter is then unclamped and allowed to turn freely until it comes to rest, when it is clamped up again. By this means any twist is taken out of the fibre. The case is next inverted so that the mirror is below the pendant, whereupon it oscillates between two stops. If necessary, the case is rotated in azimuth to enable the mirror to come to rest with its plane in the magnetic meridian. If now a theodolite is directed on the mirror and adjusted until it centres the reflected image of a plummet suspended below its own axis, the line of sight will be perpendicular to the meridian. This type of magnetometer is now obsolete. (See ""A Method of Determining the Magnetic Meridian,"" by T. Lindsay Galloway, Trans. Institute of Mining Surveyors, Vol. LVI, Part 4.)

Object entry information: This type of station keeper is essentially similar in construction to a box sextant, having a graduated arc of 6-in. radius extending over 20°. By measuring on this arc the angle subtended at his position by a fixed length on the distant object, the observer can calculate his distance from that object, or, having calculated the necessary angle, can set it on the instrument and keep his distance constant. The instrument consists of a sector-shaped box having its wider end open and its narrower end closed, save for a pin-hole aperture for sighting. At the open end, within the box, is mounted a fixed "" horizon"" mirror, whilst a movable index mirror is pivoted near the closed end and geared to an external rotating index arm, which moves over a graduated arc on the upper face of the box. The gearing is done by rack and pinion gear, which causes the index arm to rotate through twice the angle through which the index mirror moves. The arc is graduated in half-degrees from 0° to 20° and the index arm carries a vernier reading to 5′. In using the instrument the observer sights one end of the distant base directly through the space below the horizon mirror, and the other end by double reflection at the two mirrors, and moves his position or the index arm until the two ends appear coincident.

In using the instrument the observer sights one end of the distant base directly through the space below the horizon mirror, and the other end by double reflection at the two mirrors, and moves his position or the index arm until the two ends appear coincident.

Object entry information: The arms of a station pointer are often fitted with sights which permit the instrument to act as a theodolite and thus to measure the angles subtended by three known points at the observing station. On detaching the arm piece from the circle and applying it to the chart like an ordinary station pointer, the position of the observing station can be plotted. The instrument exhibited is of this combination type, and was salved from a German warship sunk at Scapa Flow. It has a graduated circle of 11-in. diam., with its edge divided on German silver to single degrees. This circular plate can rotate within a hollow central axis which terminates below in a spherical ball; this ball forms part of a ball and socket joint connecting the instrument to a stand. The plate can thus be set in any plane and clamped by means of a threaded collar acting on the joint; it can then be rotated in this plane and clamped by a radial screw threaded in its outer axis and impinging on its inner one. The arms of the instrument are mounted on a separate circular ring which has a central pin fitting within a hole in the centre of the plate. Each arm is pivoted round this pin and can be turned

Nordenfelt about 1884 for rangefinding at sea. Observations are taken with the plane of the sextant vertical from a point on board ship at a known height above sea level upon the water line of a distant object and simultaneously upon the horizon. When the horizon and water line images are made to coincide by revolving the index arm, the reading of the index on the graduated arc gives the range of the distant object directly. The index mirror is not mounted upon the pivot of the rotating arm, but upon an eccentric pivot, connected to the arm by a cam and pin mechanism, which causes the mirror to rotate through a much smaller angle than the arm; this enables the angle swept out by the reflected ray to be varied very gradually between narrow limits, whilst the index traverses an arc of 60° or thereabouts. As the angle of depression of the distant object below the horizon varies inversely as the range, if the base—i.e. the height of the observer above sea level—is constant, the arc of the sextant can be graduated to read the range directly. Different arcs are, however, necessary for different observing heights, and three are provided, two for heights of 96 ft. and the third for a height of 47 ft. ; any arc can be fixed in the sextant frame by means of clamping pins.

The central pin acts as backsight for the observation, whilst each arm has a folding slit foresight fixed at its outer end. The subtended angles can then be read off on the graduated circle if required and the arm piece removed and applied to the chart. The bevelled edges of the arms are then made to pass through the corresponding fixed points on the chart, when the central pin marks the position of the observing point. This pin is mounted loosely in the arm piece and its point kept slightly above the plane of the arms by a spring. On depressing the head of the pin, its point makes an indentation in the chart and thus plots the position of the observing station. The arms are 14 in. long from central pin to sights, but can be extended to 20 in. by means of the three extension pieces shown.

Above the camera is mounted a telescope which can sweep out a field of view perpendicular to the camera axis, so that, when the other station point of the base is sighted, the optical axis of the camera must be perpendicular to the base.
The camera box is of light metal and is mounted upon the rotatable limb of a graduated horizontal circle, which can in turn rotate within a levelling tribrach. The footscrews of the latter rest on a trivet plate, which can be clamped upon the tripod head after the vertical axis of the instrument has been centred above the station point. The camera objective is mounted in a sliding front plate and has a constant focal length of 127 mm. The plate rack takes 12 cm. by 9 cm. plates, upon which the horizon and principal vertical lines are automatically recorded during exposure.
The camera box can be detached from the tribrach by unclamping the screw which fixes the vertical axis of rotation. A similar tribrach, trivet plate and tripod is set up at the other base observing point and the camera can readily be transferred from one station to the other. In the tribrach which does not contain the camera, a signal pin can be clamped, centred above the station point, and observed from the camera station through the special telescope mounted above the camera box. This telescope has its optical axis parallel to the camera axis, but has a pentagonal prism mounted in front of its objective for deflecting the axial rays at right angles to the optical axis. The telescope fits within a sleeve rigidly fixed to the camera box, and can rotate within this sleeve about an axis coinciding with its optical axis. During this rotation it carries the deflecting prism with it, and also a vertical circle for measuring the amount of rotation. Any point viewed through the prism and telescope during this rotation must lie in the vertical plane perpendicular to the telescope axis, and therefore perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera.
To measure the length of the base, the telescope is sighted upon a horizontal rod of fixed length, which is mounted upon the tripod at the other base point, and the instrument rotated in azimuth by means of the tangent screw of the horizontal limb, which has a graduated screw-head for measuring the rotation necessary to traverse from one end of the distant rod to the other. By this means the base is measured tacheometrically.

Object entry information: The stereo-comparator is a special type of stereoscope, designed by Dr. C. Pulfrich about 1901, for measuring the relative displacement of corresponding points in the two views of an area surveyed from each end of a base, and deducing therefrom the position of the corresponding ground point with respect to the base. The position of each ground point is separately measured in terms of its azimuth, altitude and range (perpendicular to the base) from the left-hand base terminal point.
The comparator consists of a binocular telescope, very similar to a stereoscopic rangefinder, mounted above a traversing frame which carries the two negatives. Each eyepiece of the telescope carries in its focal plane a fixed index mark. When the negatives are viewed through the twin eyepieces, the observer sees a combined image of the index mark apparently suspended in space above the country surveyed, which is presented in bold relief. By operating the mechanism controlling the movements of the negative and telescope carriages the mark can be made to “touch” any point of the landscape, and the readings of the scales then give the position of that point.

The position of each ground point is separately measured in terms of its azimuth, altitude and range (perpendicular to the base) from the left-hand base terminal point. The two negatives can be traversed together in a lateral direction parallel to their horizon lines by means of a rack operated by the wheel shown on the left of the instrument and known as the ""direction"" wheel, or the right-hand plate can be moved alone in the same direction by means of the wheel on the right-hand side of the instrument. The latter is known as the ""parallax"" or ""distance"" wheel. Each movement is registered by scales and verniers, whilst the ""distance"" wheel has a micrometer drum head for recording the smaller movements. The telescope can also be moved across the negative carriage in a direction parallel to the principal vertical lines of the views by means of the ""height"" wheel, shown in front of the middle part of the instrument, and the amount of motion measured on the ""height"" scale.

By operating the mechanism controlling the movements of the negative and telescope carriages the mark can be made to “touch” any point of the landscape, and the readings of the scales then give the position of that point.

Thompson, R.E., at the School of Military Engineer- ing designed the instrument illustrated in these two photographs for the purpose of automatically plotting the positions of points obtained by a stereo-photographic survey. The apparatus consists of a Pulfrich stereo-comparator, with a pair of plotting boards traversed by rulers connected to its measuring mechanism in such a manner that the co-ordinates of the point viewed in the comparator can be automatically plotted on the boards. In the Pulfrich comparator the three co-ordinates of any point surveyed, namely its direction, altitude and range, are measured by the motions of the main slide, the microscope bridge slide and the parallax slide respectively. The two plotting boards of the stereo-plotter, which may be called the plan and ele- vation boards respectively, are provided with one common ""ordinate"" ruler and separate ""abscissa"" rulers. The two latter are geared respectively to the main slide and microscope slide mechanism of the comparator, and are moved automatic- ally over their boards by the operation of setting the comparator on the view point. The ordinate ruler has to be set by hand at a distance from the plan equal to the ""range"" of the view point as recorded on the range drum of the comparator, which drum is operated by the mechanism of setting the parallax slide. After this setting of the ordinate ruler, its point of intersection with the abscissa ruler of the plan board gives the plan point of the view point, whilst its intersection with the abscissa ruler of the elevation board gives a reading upon a scale fixed to the ordinate ruler which registers the elevation of the view point above the camera station.

Object entry information: The two negatives can be traversed together in a lateral direction parallel to their horizon lines by means of a rack operated by the wheel shown on the left of the instrument and known as the ""direction"" wheel, or the right-hand plate can be moved alone in the same direction by means of the wheel on the right-hand side of the instrument. The latter is known as the ""parallax"" or ""distance"" wheel. Each movement is registered by scales and verniers, whilst the ""distance"" wheel has a micrometer drum head for recording the smaller movements. The telescope can also be moved across the negative carriage in a direction parallel to the principal vertical lines of the views by means of the ""height"" wheel, shown in front of the middle part of the instrument, and the amount of motion measured on the ""height"" scale. The instrument is originally adjusted so that the mark appears to be at an infinite distance from the observer, in a direction coinciding with that of the principal point of the negatives, i.e. perpendicular to the base of the survey. When the mark is made to coincide with any point of the landscape, the readings of the direction, distance and height scales give the azimuth, range and altitude of that point with respect to the left base point. All the scales read to 0·01 mm. The instrument is designed to take negatives of dimensions 12 cm. by 9 cm., such as are used in the photo-theodolite, by Zeiss, illustrated in an adjacent photograph.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Carl Zeiss, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1911 (Model)
Object entry information: In 1908, Lieut. E. von Orel, of the Military Geographical Institute, designed the first model of his stereo-autograph, by means of which the points of a stereo- photographic survey could be viewed in a Pulfrich stereo-comparator and auto- matically plotted, one by one, by the movements used to set the comparator. In this early model, which resembled Thompson's stereo-plotter, the altitudes of the various points had to be separately calculated, but in 1909 Messrs. Zeiss, in conjunction with von Orel, constructed a new model in which the contours could also be automatically plotted upon the plan. In 1911 the instrument represented in the photograph exhibited was evolved. It performs all the functions of the 1909 model and in addition permits the trace of any line upon the photographs, i.e., upon the ground surveyed, to be plotted directly upon the plan ; thus contours, lines of rivers, roads, fences, etc., can all be automatically plotted by simply causing the index mark of the comparator to traverse such lines.
