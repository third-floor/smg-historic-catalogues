Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: In the course of some experiments with his Induction Balance, Prof. Hughes found that if a circuit was formed by joining up in series a battery, a microphone, and one of the coils of his balance, any interruption of the circuit was accompanied by a disturbance which became audible in a telephone receiver connected to another microphone, even when the two circuits were widely separated and there was no direct connection between them. Prof. Hughes carried out a great many experiments, many of which were witnessed by eminent men of science, but whereas Prof. Hughes was convinced that they were due to some form of conduction between the two circuits, his friends eventually came to the conclusion that they could all be accounted for by the known laws of electro-magnetic induction. It is now certain that in these experiments, Hughes, like Edison in 1875, was dealing with true Hertzian waves such as now used in wireless telegraphy, and that he was unwittingly employing for their detection the coherer method of reception which was first deliberately used for this purpose by Lodge in 1889. The microphone detector exhibited consists of a steel needle hanging in light contact with a small circular hole in a block of carbon, and is one of many forms of microphone which were tried by Prof. Hughes. Others will be found in the telephony section.

The oscillator is similar in every way to the type used by Prof. H. Hertz at Karlsruhe in 1886, and is known as a “dumb-bell” oscillator or “dipole.”
The only fundamental change which has taken place in the growth of such oscillators from the small experimental model (used purely for physical research) to the large modern antennæ measuring up to 800 ft. in height, is that it has become customary to replace the lower half of the dipole by an earth connection.

Object entry information: This is one of the oscillators used by Sir Oliver Lodge in his lecture at the Royal Institution in 1894, when wireless signals were sent and detected by his spring coherer at a distance of some 20 yards through walls.
The sphere when excited gave sparks at the ends of a diameter to two small knobs and emitted waves 7 in. in length. The radiation was very powerful, but owing to the high rate of damping the oscillator was enclosed in a copper screening device with a variable aperture, in order to prolong the duration of the waves and project them in any desired direction.
At his Lecture in 1894, “On the work of Hertz and some of his successors,” Sir Oliver Lodge used this oscillator to transmit signals from the library of the Royal Institution to the lecture table, where they were detected by his spring coherer. He also demonstrated the quasi-optical effects of the waves by refracting and polarizing them, as Hertz had done.

He also demonstrated the quasi-optical effects of the waves by refracting and polarizing them, as Hertz had done.

Date of creation: 1889
Object entry information: This spark-gap, originally used for experiments on lightning guards, was employed by Sir Oliver Lodge in 1889 as a detector of electro-magnetic waves. It represents the first deliberate application of the coherer principle to wireless reception.
In that year Sir Oliver Lodge accidentally observed that when lightning struck the guard, the opposite sides of the protective air-gap became fused together. This he considered partly due to a cohesive action, resulting in adhesion and amalgamation when a spark occurred between the knobs. An extremely feeble

Date of creation: 1899 (Patent 1900)
Object entry information: This is part of the first piece of rough experimental tuned coupled-circuit transmitting apparatus employed by Senatore Marconi at his station at ""The Haven,"" Poole Harbour, in 1899. It is the foundation of the famous ""7777"" patent of 1900. The improvements embodied in this patent were as follows:—At the transmitting end the original arrangement, called since then a ""plain aerial,"" was exchanged for one consisting of two coupled circuits. The secondary of the oscillation transformer was connected in series with an adjustable inductance in the aerial circuit, while the primary circuit included a spark gap and condenser. It is this latter portion of the original experimental apparatus which is here shown. It consists of a square wooden frame over which are wound several lengths of thickly insulated copper cable joined in parallel to form a single turn of very low resistance. The condenser and the terminals of the spark gap were connected to the secondary terminals of a 10-in. induction coil (shown at No. 10). The whole oscillation transformer when in use was generally immersed in insulating oil.

Object entry information: These are the original thermionic tubes which were made and used by Prof. Fleming in the experiments which led him from an investigation of the so-called Edison effect in 1883 to the invention in 1904 of the two-electrode thermionic valve. These valves were the precursors of other types, and with them have given rise to highly important developments in wireless telegraphy and telephony. In 1883 Mr. T. A. Edison experimented with a glow lamp having a metal plate sealed into the exhausted bulb and a carbon filament rendered incandescent by a direct electric current. He discovered that if the metal plate was connected to the positive terminal of the filament by an external wire, a feeble electric current flowed through it, whereas hardly any current flowed when the plate was connected to the negative terminal. Mr. Edison himself gave no explanation of this effect. It was assumed in 1889 that there was an emission of negatively electrified carbon atoms from the filament, but in 1899 Sir J. J. Thomson showed that they were particles of negative electricity, now called electrons. These are projected at a high speed from the incandescent filament and attracted to a positively electrified metal plate sealed into the bulb. The effect is now known as Thermionic Emission. In 1889 Prof. Fleming commenced a systematic investigation of the Edison effect, and constructed for this purpose the series of vacuous bulbs lettered A to I. Bulb C was constructed in order to prove that thermionic emission takes place in the case of an incandescent platinum wire as well as in that of an incandescent carbon filament. Bulbs D, E and F were used to test how far from the filament the emitted particles could travel to a positively electrified metal plate, and whether they could travel round an elbow-tube or only in straight lines. It was found that the thermionic current became weaker as the distance between the filament and plate (or ""anode"") was increased. Bulbs G and H were used to investigate the emission from various parts of the filament, and it was shown to be prevented by enclosing the carbon filament in a glass tube. In bulb I provision was made for the interposition of a mica plate between the anode and filament in order to find out if the transfer of negative electricity was thereby stopped. It was found that this was so. Bulbs J, K, L and M are samples of the two electrode thermionic valves which were the outcome of the foregoing experiments. Electrons are evaporated from an incandescent carbon or tungsten filament and attracted to the anode which is positively charged by means of a battery. The space between the filament and anode thus allows negative electricity to pass in one direction, but not in the opposite, and it can therefore convert the high-frequency alternating current set up in a wireless receiver into a direct current (i.e., rectify it). The sensitivity of the device is about the same as that of a crystal detector but it is completely stable in its action.

Each consists of a glass tube filled loosely with coarse filings or borings of iron contained between two metal plugs. Sir Oliver Lodge noticed that the change of resistance of the tube was proportional to the energy of electric radiation from a source of given frequency. He arranged an electro-magnetic vibrating arrangement (shown in one specimen) to produce mechanical agitation, and so destroy the incipient cohesion caused by the electric radiation. A similar arrangement was adopted by Popoff in Russia and Marconi in Italy. One of these tubes, found to have a resistance of 2,500 ohms in the sensitive state.

Object entry information: In 1890, Prof. E. Branly, of Paris, made the extremely important observation that an electric spark at a distance had the power of suddenly changing the electric conductivity of loose masses of powdered conductors. He showed that a tube of metallic filings loosely packed between metal plugs might be a conductor of very high resistance when the metallic filings were loosely arranged, but that if a discharge from a Leyden jar was made in the vicinity, the conductivity of the metallic powder was suddenly increased. Similar observations had been

Object entry information: This is the form of coherer used in 1897 by the Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft in the Slaby-Arco system of radio-telegraphy. It was used later by the British post office in experiments between Baldoyle and Howth in 1901. The coherer consists of an exhausted glass tube, narrower at its central portion, into which enter two tightly fitting silver plugs. The plugs serve as conductors, to which are soldered two little capsules cemented to the ends of the tube. A fine powder is enclosed between the faces of which are not parallel, one of them being cut on the skew so that the gap left for the powder is V-shaped. The powder only fills about half of this space, and if the coherer is placed in such a manner that the narrower portion of V space is downwards, the powder occupies the greater height in the gap, its pressure is greater, and the sensitiveness of the apparatus is at its maximum. If, on the contrary, the larger portion of the V is turned downwards, the powder takes a lower level, and exercises less pressure, so that the sensitiveness of the coherer is at a minimum. The tube is rested on supports that permit it to rotate; this gives a means of controlling the degree of sensitiveness.

Object entry information: This coherer was patented in 1902, and perfected by Sir Oliver Lodge and Dr. Alexander Muirhead, who had always advocated continuous decoherence by means of magnetic tappers then in use, wherein electro-magnetic tappers were brought into operation only on the receipt of signals. A small and perfectly true steel wheel is specially ground to a smooth knife edge and is kept in rotation by the clockwork which drives the siphon recorder used to record the messages received. The edge of the wheel grazes the convex surface of a small column of mercury contained in an ebonite cup, the height of which can be adjusted so that the wheel dips more or less below the surface. A drop of oil is placed on the top of the cup, and a small pad of wash-leather bears upon the edge of the wheel to keep it clean. An adjustable potential divider, supplied by a battery, maintains a potential difference just insufficient to break down the film of oil which the rotation of the wheel draws in between its edge and the mercury. The oscillating potential difference set up by an incoming wave-train breaks down this film, allowing a current to pass at the place of contact and operating the siphon recorder. On the cessation of each wave-train, the oil is drawn in again, decohering the instrument, i.e., restoring it to its normal resistance, which is almost infinite. In reliability and sensitiveness this appliance was superior to any detector known at the time, and signals were received with great reliability and precision in express trains at 60 m.p.h.

Maker/Donor: Presented by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: The action of this detector is to some extent based on the results of experiments by Prof. Sir E. Rutherford and others. It was patented by Senatore Marconi in 1902, and was largely used in ship receiving sets on account of its reliability. An endless band, consisting of a number of strands of insulated iron wire, passes over two pulleys which are made to rotate slowly by clockwork. Near to a part of the band two horseshoe magnets are fixed with similar poles adjacent, and at this point, where a large number of lines of force pass into the band, the latter passes through a tube surrounded by two coils. The inner coil is connected with the aerial and earth wires, and the outer coil with the telephone receiver. This arrangement of magnets and coils is duplicated at another point of the band so that two telephones may be used or the coils may be connected in series, which often increases the strength of the signals. As the band travels slowly through the coils, the lines of force are drawn out in the direction of its motion owing to the retentivity of the iron, but when oscillatory currents arrive from the aerial circuit these lines are freed and a rapid change takes place in the magnetic field. This causes a current to flow through both coil and telephone circuit and gives a signal. (See also No. 196.)

Object entry information: The use of crystal detectors in receiving circuits renders it possible to “detect” the high-frequency currents set up in the receiving aerial, by completely rectifying the alternating current into a current whose mean value is no longer zero, and then using a polarised electro-magnetic indicator (a telephone). This is due to the fact that with certain minerals, usually crystalline, the resistance to the flow of electricity across the contact between a piece of metal, and a piece of the mineral, or between two pieces of different minerals, depends largely on the value of the current, even when the current is extremely small, and does not obey Ohm's law. Thus the P.D. current characteristic has a pronounced curvature, and consequently if an alternating E.M.F., whose mean value is zero, is applied to the crystal the mean value of the resulting current is not zero. This current is spoken of as the “rectified current.” The specimen shown is a silicon crystal, the contact being made between a crystal of silicon and steel. It is now mounted in a locket, but it was formerly used in the wireless installation of the cargo vessel S.S. “Nonsuch.” This was the first British cargo vessel to carry a wireless installation, and on September 16th, 1910, when off the coast of Morocco, she received messages from

It was patented by Senatore Marconi in 1902, and was largely used in ship receiving sets on account of its reliability. An endless band, consisting of a number of strands of insulated iron wire, passes over two pulleys which are made to rotate slowly by clockwork. Near to a part of the band two horseshoe magnets are fixed with similar poles adjacent, and at this point, where a large number of lines of force pass into the band, the latter passes through a tube surrounded by two coils. The inner coil is connected with the aerial and earth wires, and the outer coil with the telephone receiver. This arrangement of magnets and coils is duplicated at another point of the band so that two telephones may be used or the coils may be connected in series, which often increases the strength of the signals. As the band travels slowly through the coils, the lines of force are drawn out in the direction of its motion owing to the retentivity of the iron, but when oscillatory currents arrive from the aerial circuit these lines are freed and a rapid change takes place in the magnetic field. This causes a current to flow through both coil and telephone circuit and gives a signal. (See also No. 196.)",Inv. 1920-687.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

Object name: LEAD PEROXIDE DETECTOR.
Maker/Donor: Made and presented by Mr. S. G. Brown, Esq., F.R.S.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a detector of the self-restoring type, invented by Mr. S. G. Brown, Esq., F.R.S. It is sometimes classed as a coherer and at others as an electrolytic detector. It consists essentially of a pellet of peroxide of lead held between a plate of lead and one of platinum. If an external electromotive force from a single secondary cell is impressed upon it so that the current flows through the peroxide from platinum to lead, a counter electromotive force will be experienced by this current due to the electro-chemical action of the lead-peroxide of lead-platinum couple. Mr. Brown found that the passage of oscillations through this couple increased its counter electro-motive force by stimulating chemical action, and so reducing the current sent through it by the external cell. The couple acts, therefore, as a conductor of which the resistance is increased by electric oscillations. The pellet of peroxide is mounted in a holder in which an adjustable pressure can be applied, and placed in series with a galvanometer and single cell. When oscillations occur the deflection of the galvanometer decreases, but increases again when they cease.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This detector, for which a patent was applied for by Dr. Lee de Forest in 1901, depends for its action on the increase of resistance in an electrollizable mixture caused by the passage of an oscillatory current. The detector itself consists of a tube containing two small metal electrode plugs, between the ends of which is a space of about 1/200 in. In this space is placed an electrollizable mixture of glycerine or vaseline mixed with water or alcohol, and a small quantity of litharge and metallic filings. These metallic filings act as secondary electrodes. If a small E.M.F. is applied to the electrodes of this tube through a resistance of about 25,000 ohms, and the two electrodes are connected to aerial and earth respectively, then theory supposes that on the arrival of a signal, oscillatory currents will pass through the cell, where they break up the chains of metallic particles. This interrupts the current passing through the telephones, and gives rise to a click. A rapid succession of oscillatory sparks is heard as a short continuous sound in the telephone receivers.

Object entry information: The apparatus here shown represents a transmitting and a receiving group constructed for demonstration purposes in the early days of wireless telegraphy. The transmitter comprises a small induction coil, to the secondary terminals of which two adjustable metal spheres are connected: a Morse key is connected in the primary circuit. The primary condenser consists of alternate sheets of tinfoil and paper, and is joined across the interrupter contacts, its functions being to reduce the break spark, and to demagnetise the core quickly. The intermittent high voltages generated in the secondary coil produce charges on the secondary condenser, setting up a state of electric strain across the gap. When the gap is set to such a width that the maximum charge on the condenser reaches a value sufficient to break down the insulation of the air, a current will flow across the gap. After a small fraction of time the discharge equalises the potentials, causing the electric strain to be removed; ultimately the condenser again charges up, and discharges across the gap, but in the opposite direction. By this means, electro-magnetic waves are generated, and radiated through the aether, the waves being heavily damped, owing to the losses in the circuit.

By this means, electro-magnetic waves are generated, and radiated through the aether, the waves being heavily damped, owing to the losses in the circuit. The receiver consists of two long strips of copper foil arranged in the same line, but separated by a coherer. This consists of a narrow glass tube, exhausted of air, having two plugs of silver attached to platinum wires. Between these plugs is a space partly filled with a metallic powder, composed of 95 per cent. nickel and 5 per cent. silver. In its normal state this presents a high resistance to the passage of an electric current. When electric oscillations are set up in the coherer circuit, the resistance falls very considerably owing to an apparent cohesion of the filings, and a current can pass of sufficient strength to operate a relay.
The resistance remains at its low value until the tube is tapped and decohered.
The tapper consists of an electro-magnet having vibrating armature arranged in circuit with the coherer and battery. Immediately the coherer becomes a conductor the armature is pulled down, thereby completing another circuit containing battery and electric bell, the clapper of which communicates vibration to the metallic powder. The moment the electro-magnetic radiation ceases, the final blow of the clapper renders the coherer a non-conductor, thus breaking the bell circuit.",Inv. 1904-65.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

Object entry information: The receiver consists of two long strips of copper foil arranged in the same line, but separated by a coherer. This consists of a narrow glass tube, exhausted of air, having two plugs of silver attached to platinum wires. Between these plugs is a space partly filled with a metallic powder, composed of 95 per cent. nickel and 5 per cent. silver. In its normal state this presents a high resistance to the passage of an electric current. When electric oscillations are set up in the coherer circuit, the resistance falls very considerably owing to an apparent cohesion of the filings, and a current can pass of sufficient strength to operate a relay.
The resistance remains at its low value until the tube is tapped and decohered.
The tapper consists of an electro-magnet having vibrating armature arranged in circuit with the coherer and battery. Immediately the coherer becomes a conductor the armature is pulled down, thereby completing another circuit containing battery and electric bell, the clapper of which communicates vibration to the metallic powder. The moment the electro-magnetic radiation ceases, the final blow of the clapper renders the coherer a non-conductor, thus breaking the bell circuit.

Date of creation: Patented in 1907
Object entry information: This type of receiver, patented in 1907 by Mr. C. S. Franklin and the makers, was much used on Marconi ship outfits in conjunction with the magnetic detector. The detector, being of low resistance, works on current rather than voltage effects, and hence in this receiver, capacity effects predominate and inductance effects are small.
The receiver has three circuits, aerial, intermediate, and detector, each of which must be tuned, and the tuning switches are so connected together that the three circuits may be roughly tuned simultaneously. Finer adjustments are then made by means of the three variable condensers in the three circuits. These condensers are seen on the top of the case. The degree of coupling may be altered by moving the axis of the coils of the intermediate circuit relatively to the aerial and detector circuit coils. This is effected by rotating a handle on the side of the case. The aerial loading inductance is adjusted by means of a multiple contact switch on the left front of the case.
A two-way throw-over switch is mounted on the top of the case; in the “stand-by” position it connects the detector directly into the aerial circuit, and when signals are received it is thrown over to the “tune” position so that the detector circuit is coupled to the intermediate circuit and accurate tuning can take place.
The instrument is designed to tune to all wave lengths from 300 ft. to 8,000 ft.

With the change-over switch at the “stand by” position, the detector is connected direct in the aerial circuit for quick searching. With the switch at “tune,” the detector is included in a closed circuit, thereby increasing the selectivity, since foreign oscillations will have little effect on the sharply tuned closed circuit, particularly if the coupling is weak. This closed circuit is completed through a roller on the switch, when the latter is at the “tune” position, but is left incomplete at other times in order to avoid energy losses. A three-way detector switch is provided so that either a perikon (chalcopyrites and zincite), a carborundum (with potentiometer) or a valve detector may be used. The valve detector is not included with this set; the terminals marked “valve” must be connected to a separate panel when crystal detection is not used. The set is also provided with a switch marked “detector tap,” which enables the detector to be connected across the optimum portion of the closed circuit inductance to minimise its damping effect. The buzzer is used for adjusting the receiver and crystal detectors. The tuner coils are “bank-wound” with litzendraht (stranded) wire. (See also No. 50).

Object entry information: This receiver is of German manufacture and was designed for crystal reception of wave lengths ranging from 200 to 6,000 metres. It was taken from the German submarine V.50. The apparatus is mounted on an ebonite panel, the internal connections being made with stiff wire, enamelled in distinctive colours, so that the various circuits can be traced out. In the centre of the panel is the adjustment “Drehkopplung” for varying the coupling between aerial and detector circuits. At the top, on the left, is provided a barrel switch, by means of which the aerial and closed circuit are adjusted in ten steps for different ranges of wave lengths. The right-hand barrel switch enables either of the detector circuits to be adjusted on each wave length for three degrees of coupling—tight, medium and loose (“fest,” “mittel,” and “lose”). The detectors used are pyrites and carborundum—for which a small two-way switch, “Detektor Wahler,” is fitted at the top of the instrument. A plug-in coil on the right-hand side must be inserted for wave lengths ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 metres. The terminals at the bottom are the aerial and closed circuit condensers, for tuning purposes.

Crystal reception is used, and all alterations of circuit and wave-length are effected by means of barrel switches and variable condensers. No metal is used in or near any coils, wooden or bone screws being employed, probably in order to cut down eddy current losses. Most of the coupling rods, cranks, etc., are of insulating material, all joints being pinned.

Maker/Donor: Made by Army Signals Experimental Establishment. Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: During the War (1914–1918).
Object entry information: This tuner, which was designed during the War (1914–1918), is suitable for the reception of wave lengths ranging from 2,500 to 10,500 metres. With the change-over switch at the “stand by” position, the detector is connected direct in the aerial circuit for quick searching. With the switch at “tune,” the detector is included in a closed circuit, thereby increasing the selectivity, since foreign oscillations will have little effect on the sharply tuned closed circuit, particularly if the coupling is weak. This closed circuit is completed through a roller on the switch, when the latter is at the “tune” position, but is left incomplete at other times in order to avoid energy losses. A three-way detector switch is provided so that either a perikon (chalcopyrites and zincite), a carborundum (with potentiometer) or a valve detector may be used. The valve detector is not included with this set; the terminals marked “valve” must be connected to a separate panel when crystal detection is not used. The set is also provided with a switch marked “detector tap,” which enables the detector to be connected across the optimum portion of the closed circuit inductance to minimise its damping effect. The buzzer is used for adjusting the receiver and crystal detectors. The tuner coils are “bank-wound” with litzendraht (stranded) wire. (See also No. 50).

Object entry information: This receiver is of German manufacture and was designed for crystal reception of wave lengths ranging from 200 to 6,000 metres. It was taken from the German submarine V.50. The apparatus is mounted on an ebonite panel, the internal connections being made with stiff wire, enamelled in distinctive colours, so that the various circuits can be traced out. In the centre of the panel is the adjustment “Drehkopplung” for varying the coupling between aerial and detector circuits. At the top, on the left, is provided a barrel switch, by means of which the aerial and closed circuit are adjusted in ten steps for different ranges of wave lengths. The right-hand barrel switch enables either of the detector circuits to be adjusted on each wave length for three degrees of coupling—tight, medium and loose (“fest,” “mittel,” and “lose”). The detectors used are pyrites and carborundum—for which a small two-way switch, “Detektor Wahler,” is fitted at the top of the instrument. A plug-in coil on the right-hand side must be inserted for wave lengths ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 metres. The terminals at the bottom are the aerial and closed circuit condensers, for tuning purposes.

In all types of gap the passage of the spark ionises the air and makes it temporarily conducting. The gap therefore functions as an automatic switch.
Stationary spark gaps of this kind arc not constant in action. There is a tendency toward the formation of an arc across the ionised gap, wasting power and delaying the recovery of the insulating properties of the gap. Moreover, the interval between successive sparks is apt to be very uneven, as the spark takes place between a succession of pairs of points.

Maker/Donor: [N/A]
Date of creation: 1901 and 1902
Object entry information: The set, which is now incomplete, is in a box measuring 21 in. by 21 in. by 26 3/4 in., on the top of which was a small motor mounted on felt and worked off 220 volts. This motor was started and stopped by the first motor direction, clockwise or anti-clockwise, of the switch marked “ Prüfschalter ” (test-switch). This drove a small toothed wheel, the teeth bearing on a spring contact and cut and spaced so that the word “ Kiel ” was spelt out in morse. A vibratory contact was also incorporated in this circuit, which was intended to facilitate adjustment of the crystals.
Five of these were detachably fitted and chosen at will by a switch (Detektor Wähler) as well as one “ Tonprüf Detektor ” for use when listening-in.
On the right hand side of the box, at the top, was mounted the “ Syncron-Summer,” an instrument for cutting out interference from a local generator.
On the front is a switch marked “ Schaltungswähler ” (circuit-choosing switch). This has six stops marked :—
(1) Prim. (White Stud).
(2) Prim. (Yellow).
(3) Sek. (Red.)
(4) Sek. (White.)
(5) Leibenröhe (Valve circuit—Red.)
(6) Leibenröhe (White.)
The resulting change of circuit effected is shown on the diagram.
The remaining switches control the capacity, inductance and coupling valves in these circuits.
The valve circuit employed was probably a two-valve high frequency amplifier.

Object name: RIGHI PATTERN SHORT WAVE OIL-IMMERSED OSCILLATOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by R. P. Howgrave-Graham, Esq.
Date of creation: about 1896
Object entry information: This type of oscillator was invented by Prof. Righi, of Bologna, about 1896, and was used by Senatore Marconi during his early experiments, until superseded by the type of multiple oscillator shown at No. 7. It was also used for the generation of short Hertzian waves, such as are used for demonstrating quasi-optical phenomena.
The immersion of the sparking surfaces in oil tends to increase the incon-veniently small energy of emission which is generally obtained with oscillators of such small capacity, as a high potential difference is reached before the oil breaks down.
The gap resistance is reasonably low immediately after the disruption of the spark, whereas between surfaces far enough apart in air to make the breakdown-strength equal to that of the short oil gap, the ohmic resistance of the spark would be so high that oscillations would be feeble or non-existent. Such oscillators are troublesome as high-power radiators because the oil decomposes, and if the succession of sparks is rapid the oil has not time to close in and fill the gap when a spark has taken place. In such a case only the first of a stream of sparks is oscillatory, and after its passage the oil is worse than useless.

Object name: ADJUSTABLE SPARK GAP.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This early form of spark gap consists of two cylindrical steel rods having flat ends, between which the spark is formed. The rods are urged apart by springs, and by compressing the springs the gap can be adjusted.
In all types of gap the passage of the spark ionises the air and makes it temporarily conducting. The gap therefore functions as an automatic switch.
Stationary spark gaps of this kind arc not constant in action. There is a tendency toward the formation of an arc across the ionised gap, wasting power and delaying the recovery of the insulating properties of the gap. Moreover, the interval between successive sparks is apt to be very uneven, as the spark takes place between a succession of pairs of points.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office. (Designed by Mr. J. G. Balsillie)
Date of creation: about 1910
Object entry information: This is an early form of rotary spark gap, designed by Mr. J. G. Balsillie, about 1910. The main advantage of such gaps is that any tendency towards arcing is checked by the rotation of the electrodes, which wear out any incipient arc. In the present example this effect is heightened by the peculiar shape of the rotating electrodes, which produce a large air pressure between the surfaces when they are in close proximity. The direction of rotation is, of course, such that the convex surface of a moving electrode is the first to reach the fixed electrode. (See also No. 57.)

Date of creation: Constructed in 1914.
Object entry information: This instrument is the original model, constructed in 1914, of the high-tension generators working upon the “Buffer Transformer” principle, which were extensively employed during the war in spark transmitting sets (Wilson 130-watt transmitters and 54a transmitters), and later in the Mercantile Marine for ships main and emergency spark transmitters, also in X-ray and electro-medical diathermy apparatus. The instrument takes 5 amperes at 100 volts D.C., and is designed to charge a .01 mfd. condenser to a sparking voltage of 11,000 at a spark frequency of about 600 per second. The instrument consists of a motor-driven interrupter and two transformers, (a) the high-tension transformer, the secondary of which is connected to the spark gap, .01 mfd. condenser, etc., (b) the “buffer transformer,” the secondary of which is connected to a .4 mfd. condenser. The primary windings of the transformers are connected in series with the interrupter. The interrupter consists of a disc of insulating material, mounted on the shaft of the motor, with nine equally spaced copper segments embedded in its outer surface. The copper segments serve to make and break contact with two copper brushes rubbing on the periphery of the disc. When the interrupter is rotated at the correct speed, 4,000 r.p.m., and the signalling key in the supply circuit is closed, the E.M.F.s induced at “make” in the secondary of the “buffer transformer,” set that circuit into a state of continuous oscillation. The interrupter is adjusted so that it opens and closes the primary circuit at moments when the “buffer” secondary current is passing through zero values, so that one half oscillation occurs during “make” and the other half oscillation during “break.” The coupling between these two circuits during “make” causes that half-wave to be higher in amplitude

When the interrupter is rotated at the correct speed, 4,000 r.p.m., and the signalling key in the supply circuit is closed, the E.M.F.s induced at “make” in the secondary of the “buffer transformer,” set that circuit into a state of continuous oscillation. The interrupter is adjusted so that it opens and closes the primary circuit at moments when the “buffer” secondary current is passing through zero values, so that one half oscillation occurs during “make” and the other half oscillation during “break.” The coupling between these two circuits during “make” causes that half-wave to be higher in amplitude

Object entry information: This instrument consists of a vibrating converter with transformer and valve rectifier, and is designed to provide a steady H.T. supply for the transmitters of military wireless field sets. The instrument takes 5-6 amps. at 20 volts and supplies about 50 milliamps. at 1,000 volts. The converter consists essentially of an induction coil having two primary windings wound in opposite directions, and one secondary winding. The two primary windings have one common end, which is connected with the negative pole of the direct-current supply, the other two ends being connected with two contact screws on spring arms between which vibrates a polarised armature carrying a contact. This armature is connected with the positive supply, and by making contact alternately with each primary winding, an alternating E.M.F. is generated in the secondary winding. The converter is designed to give 100 volts at 350 cycles per second, and this E.M.F. is applied to the primary of a transformer and stepped up to about 3,200 volts. The ends of the secondary winding of the transformer are connected with the anodes of two U.3 rectifying valves (not shown) which become alternately about 1,500 volts positive and 1,600 volts negative with respect to a tapping in the middle of the winding. The tapping is connected with the valve filaments through a 1 mfd. condenser, the plates of which are connected with the H.T. positive and negative terminals, and are thus always charged in the same direction by pulses of current. Discharging at the same time through the valves of the transmitter the plates assume, therefore, a potential such that the quantity of electricity flowing in from the transformer is approximately equal to the quantity flowing in from the transmitter. This potential is about 1,000 volts and the ""ripple"" or amplitude of the alternating component of H.T. voltage is 2 to 3 per cent.

Object entry information: These 20-watt spark transmitters and receivers for wave-lengths of 65 or 80 metres were designed during the War of 1914–1918 for use in the forward areas. The rear transmitter consists of an induction coil, with its secondary connected across a spark gap and closed oscillatory circuit, which is coupled to a coil connected with the aerial and earth terminals. This set used an aerial; the front transmitter employed a 3 ft. loop of one turn. The front receiver is for use with two “R” type valves (not shown): The first is a retro-active amplifier-rectifier, in which rectification is performed by the cumulative grid method, the reactive coupling being introduced between the grid and plate circuits. This is coupled by a low frequency inter-valve transformer to the second valve which acts as a note-magnifier. In the plate circuit of this valve is connected a telephone transformer. This receiver only differs from the rear receiver in that two short lengths of insulated wires are connected to the aerial and earth terminals in place of the more conspicuous and troublesome aerial system.

They named this a ""Gas Relay,"" and in its final form it was fully described in November, 1913.
Like the Audion, it could be used as a generator of electrical oscillations, but it was intended to be used mainly as an amplifier of speech currents, and it was the first triode to be definitely so employed.
The appearance of this tube aroused fresh interest in the whole subject, and the Lieben-Reisz Relay shares with the Audion and the Fleming valve the distinction of having brought about a revolution in methods of electrical communication.
The tube differs from the Audion in having an oxide-coated filament, a type which has since been widely used in ""dull-emitter"" valves. The principle is due to Wehnelt, who, in 1904, discovered that strongly heated oxides, particularly those of calcium and barium, emit electrons at very low voltages.
The cathode in this case is a platinum strip 1 metre in length and 0.02 mm. in width, wound in a zigzag form on a glass support, and is coated in the manner described above.
The grid is a circular aluminium plate perforated with holes about 3.5 mm. in diameter, while the anode is a short spiral of 2 mm. aluminium wire, placed at the apex of the tube.
The cathode is brought to a bright red heat at a temperature of about 1,000 deg. C. by a battery of 30 volts; the necessary anode voltage being 220.
In the early experiments it was found difficult to obtain a uniform discharge owing to variation of the gas pressure inside the tube. It was therefore decided to replace the gas discharge with a vapour discharge by introducing mercury vapour inside the tube, constancy of pressure being obtained by means of a small quantity of mercury amalgam placed in the side tube.
For speech frequency a magnification constant of 33 was obtained with this relay, and the inventors described a cascade connection similar to those which are now common, by means of which an amplification of 20,000 times was obtained from four tubes.

But the presence of such an amount of gas as is indicated by a pressure of 1/10,000 mm. of mercury, led to great instability, so that the results obtained with these gas tubes were often most uncertain. Until 1915, however, it had been concluded that the presence of some gas was necessary in a valve. In that year Dr. Irving Langmuir, of the General Electric Company of America, as the result of research based on the earlier work of Dr. J. A> Fleming, Sir J. J. Thomson and Prof. O. W. Richardson, produced the first commercial tubes in which the action was demonstrably due to pure electron discharge from the filament, and not to the presence of minute traces of gas. One of these tubes, a diode, he named a ""Kenetron."" The other, an example of which is here shown, was called a ""Pliotron."" In this tube, which is intended for amplification of radio signals, the filament is of tungsten and the grid and anode are of nickel wire. The grid is wound with very fine wire supported on a glass framework, and the characteristic curve is such that the anode-grid slope conductance is about 0.275 ma. per grid volt. The general form of the curve is given by :- ia = A (Va + m Vg).312 where ia is the anode current, Va is the anode voltage, Vg the grid voltage and m a constant depending on the relative shapes and positions of the electrodes. By means of an original mercury condensation pump Dr. Langmuir succeeded in exhausting these tubes down to a pressure o fthe order of 1/100,000 mm. of mercury, at which pressure the characteristics of the valve are perfectly smooth and regular.

Object entry information: Another very similar valve evolved experimentally from the R.4 series, in which quantity production showed that the characteristics did not conform to those obtained experimentally, and were not so good as the round “V.24” until the filament has been redesigned to give a saturation current four times the working current, instead of about twice.

Object name: “ROUND” TRANSMITTING VALVE.
Maker/Donor: Made by Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company. Lent by H.M. Postmaster-General.
Date of creation: 1913
Object entry information: Amongst the first to be designed, and intermediate between the audion and the pliotron. Produced by Mr. J. H. Round, of the Marconi Company, in 1913. The cylindrical anode and grid construction, now so common, should be compared with the flat plates of the audion valve. Since the performance of the tube depends to a great extent on the degree of vacuum maintained, a means of varying this is provided. It consists of a small pouch blown in the glass and sealed inside the bulb, in which a quantity of asbestos is placed. On warming the asbestos a certain amount of the gas occluded by it is liberated, and in this way the progressive hardening which occurs under certain conditions when the tube is in use can be corrected. The transmitting tube contains three separate filaments which can be used in turn until all three have been burnt out. Successful radio-telephony was carried out by Mr. J. H. Round in June, 1914, with a continuous-wave transmitter containing a tube of this type. The filaments are of the Wehnelt oxide-coated type.

The high melting point of this material and its low coefficient of expansion enable it to be used without fear of collapse or fracture, although within 1 cm. of the sheet molybdenum anode, the working temperature of which is about 1,500 degs. absolute. The grid is constructed of helically wound tungsten wire supported on molybdenum rods. The filament is also of tungsten wire, kept taut by a helical spring of molybdenum. The triode is capable of dissipating 1 kw. at its anode and will deliver up to 3 kw. of high-frequency energy to the transmitting antenna. The anode supply voltage is 4,000 and upwards; the filament consumes 10 amps. at 14 volts.

Object name: OSCILLATORY VALVE RELAY.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: 1918 (invented).
Object entry information: This relay, which combines remarkable sensitivity with unusual robustness, was invented by Capt. L. B. Turner in 1918. Its action depends upon the sudden rise of mean anode current in a triode under certain conditions when passing from the non-oscillating to the oscillating state. In its later developments it has enabled considerable progress to be made in the recording of high-speed wireless signals. Valve relays can be constructed for signals of either high or low frequency. The present example is for wireless signals of wave-lengths between 1,400 and 3,000 metres. A circuit of the type shown in the accompanying diagram is so adjusted that the arrival of a signal raises momentarily the grid potential of the triode sufficiently to start oscillation, and the resultant rise of anode current is used to trip an ordinary electro-magnetic relay. The grid potential is finely adjustable on the potentiometer P, and when it is set, a small amount called the “margin,” below the critical value called the “threshold,” any signal applied to the circuit producing in it a momentary E.M.F. of the right sense and exceeding the margin in amplitude, sets the system into oscillation. The accompanying rise of current in the coils of the relay pulls over the tongue T, short-circuiting the reaction coil and thereby quenching the oscillation, which is thereupon reignited only by the arrival of another signal. As long as the grid potential remains above the threshold value the tongue will chatter against the marking contact M, and by this means the signal can be made to actuate any recording device, such as a type-printing machine. It will be noticed that unlike other receivers the oscillatory valve relay embodies neither heterodyne nor separate detector. In the form in which it is shown here it is suitable for the reception of signals transmitted at speeds up to 40 or 50 words per minute.

Object entry information: This type of tube, used for wireless transmission, has a bulb of pure silica. The high melting point of this material and its low coefficient of expansion enable it to be used without fear of collapse or fracture, although within 1 cm. of the sheet molybdenum anode, the working temperature of which is about 1,500 degs. absolute. The grid is constructed of helically wound tungsten wire supported on molybdenum rods. The filament is also of tungsten wire, kept taut by a helical spring of molybdenum. The triode is capable of dissipating 1 kw. at its anode and will deliver up to 3 kw. of high-frequency energy to the transmitting antenna. The anode supply voltage is 4,000 and upwards; the filament consumes 10 amps. at 14 volts.

Object name: OSCILLATORY VALVE RELAY.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: 1918 (invented).
Object entry information: This relay, which combines remarkable sensitivity with unusual robustness, was invented by Capt. L. B. Turner in 1918. Its action depends upon the sudden rise of mean anode current in a triode under certain conditions when passing from the non-oscillating to the oscillating state. In its later developments it has enabled considerable progress to be made in the recording of high-speed wireless signals. Valve relays can be constructed for signals of either high or low frequency. The present example is for wireless signals of wave-lengths between 1,400 and 3,000 metres. A circuit of the type shown in the accompanying diagram is so adjusted that the arrival of a signal raises momentarily the grid potential of the triode sufficiently to start oscillation, and the resultant rise of anode current is used to trip an ordinary electro-magnetic relay. The grid potential is finely adjustable on the potentiometer P, and when it is set, a small amount called the “margin,” below the critical value called the “threshold,” any signal applied to the circuit producing in it a momentary E.M.F. of the right sense and exceeding the margin in amplitude, sets the system into oscillation. The accompanying rise of current in the coils of the relay pulls over the tongue T, short-circuiting the reaction coil and thereby quenching the oscillation, which is thereupon reignited only by the arrival of another signal. As long as the grid potential remains above the threshold value the tongue will chatter against the marking contact M, and by this means the signal can be made to actuate any recording device, such as a type-printing machine. It will be noticed that unlike other receivers the oscillatory valve relay embodies neither heterodyne nor separate detector. In the form in which it is shown here it is suitable for the reception of signals transmitted at speeds up to 40 or 50 words per minute.

Object entry information: anode may be of the order of 20 micro-microfarads or more. This capacity acts as a shunt condenser and seriously lowers the impedance of the resistance for high frequencies. For this reason amplifiers of that type are only suitable for comparatively long wave-lengths.
By the use of special anti-capacity valves and by exercising care in the amplifier connections it is possible to make an amplifier capable of working fairly efficiently on wave-lengths as low as 200. Such an amplifier is here shown.
It will be seen that the leading-in wires to the grid and anode of the valve are separated and brought in through separate seals. The practice is now common, but was first adopted by the French Military Service in this modification of their original general-purpose valve.

They consist of coils of iron wire enclosed in hydrogen in a glass tube, the resistance of iron increases with temperature, so that slight variations of filament current due to fluctuations in battery voltage are checked.
The transformers have open iron cores and are shielded both magnetically and electrically by concentric cases of iron and brass. This can be seen in the example, which has been taken apart.

Object entry information: In this amplifier, designed by the French Military Service, there are five stages of high-frequency amplification, one of detection and two stages of low-frequency amplification. The first five stages are resistance-capacity coupled, and the last two have iron-cored transformers.
For the purpose of obtaining high-frequency retroaction, as, for example, in the reception of continuous-wave signals, a special type of condenser, having one set of moving vanes and two sets of fixed vanes, is employed. By means of this condenser and a suitably connected switch, capacity can be introduced between any two of the electrodes in the high-frequency portion of the amplifier, and when these two electrodes are in antiphase reaction will occur.
This type of amplifier was used during the War of 1914–18 with frame antennæ for the reception of long wave stations. As is well known, the use of resistance-capacity coupling for high-frequency amplification necessitates special precautions if the instrument is to be used with wave-lengths of the order of 600 metres.

(b) A coupling unit, by means of which the signal note heard in the amplifiers can be compared with the unamplified signal.
(c) An artificial earth circuit. A diagram of the apparatus is shown. The set was also used for comparing the low-frequency magnification of the ""R"" valve in these amplifiers, to the shaft of a Wilson motor, to the shaft of which is fitted an aluminium disc with 24 iron teeth. These teeth pass in front of the magnet of a telephone receiver, and the combination forms a small power alternator. The shaft of the motor is fitted with a speed indicator, so that the alternator can be run to give a definite note. On the same board is an electric bell magnet, the hammer of which makes and breaks a contact which short-circuits the telephone magnet coil, and so interrupts the alternator current periodically, thus producing a current consisting of a succession of dots. Across the contacts of the electric bell magnet circuit is a 4 mfd. condenser, which prevents the noise due to the spark from passing to the amplifier. Piece B. The Coupling Board.—This consists of two large coils, one of which can slide along a graduated bar, so that the coupling between the two can be varied. The current from the alternator passes through the fixed coil; the movable coil being connected to the dummy earth (piece c) which is connected to the amplifier to be tested. The energy transferred to the amplifier can thus be varied by altering the coupling. To the fixed coil is coupled a small coil whose position cannot be varied. A change-over switch, which operates by pressing and releasing, enables one to connect the telephone to this fixed coil on pressing, and to the telephone terminals of the amplifier under test on releasing. The fixed coil yields a constant comparison signal. When the 'phones are connected to the amplifier they are shunted with a resistance of 70 ohms, which enables a louder signal to be amplified and so reduces the relative intensity of amplifier noises with the signal. Piece C. The Dummy Earth.—This consists of a choke (the primary of a transformer) and a series of resistances. The signal from the movable coil of piece “B” passes through the choke, and through a resistance of 14,000 ohms, with tappings at 50, 200, 800 and 14,000 ohms. The lines to the amplifier are tapped across these resistances by means of the 5-stud switch. The choke keeps a resistance permanently in the ""earth” circuit, the respective resistances being selected to suit the earth-to-valve transformer of the C, Mark III amplifier. It will be seen that the apparatus enables the amplified signal derived from an amplifier to be compared with a signal of fixed intensity which is approximately that of an amplifier of satisfactory performance. Since the amplification from any actual instrument is not very constant, the method is more satisfactory than that of obtaining a direct comparison.",Inv. 1924-178.,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

The instrument was widely used for the reception of continuous-wave signals before the invention of the thermionic valve. If a continuous train of undamped waves is emitted from the transmitting antenna, for example in the case of a morse dash signal, the use of a simple rectifying detector at the receiving station merely gives rise to clicks in the telephone receivers corresponding to the beginning and end of the train. The principle employed in the “ Tikker ” is that of interrupting the flow of current to the telephones at an acoustic frequency by means of the vibrating contact described above. The received signals then assume an audible musical note of the same frequency. The apparatus was principally employed in conjunction with the Poulsen arc.

In the accompanying model, which may be operated with the controls provided, both frequencies have been brought within the audible range for demonstration purposes. One of the beats can be made by slowly turning the handle, and the beats can be made to cease owing to automatic synchronisation of the two oscillators caused by unavoidable coupling between them. In operating the model the triode filaments must first be switched on by means of the plunger. A diagram of connections is given, from which it will be seen that two triodes are associated with appropriate iron-core transformers and tuning condensers for the generation of two undamped oscillations of low frequency.

This “heterodyne” method of reception was invented by R. A. Fessenden in the United States in 1902, and is now almost universally employed in the reception of continuous waves. In the accompanying model, which may be operated with the controls provided, both frequencies have been brought within the audible range for demonstration purposes. One of the beats can be made by slowly turning the handle, and the beats can be made to cease owing to automatic synchronisation of the two oscillators caused by unavoidable coupling between them. In operating the model the triode filaments must first be switched on by means of the plunger. A diagram of connections is given, from which it will be seen that two triodes are associated with appropriate iron-core transformers and tuning condensers for the generation of two undamped oscillations of low frequency. These oscillations are combined in one circuit and are handed to a two-stage audio-frequency amplifier, the output of which is connected to a loud-speaking telephone.

Object entry information: This is a portable military set, designed for use in the forward area for ranges up to 4,000 yards, using a low single wire aerial, suspended at an average height of 3 ft. from the ground. The transmitting group consists of a transmitter Mark III*, a 30-watt high-tension unit and 10-volt, 16-amp. accumulator. The receiving group consists of a Receiver Mark III and selector. (a) *Transmitting Group.*—The transmitter consists essentially of a valve oscillator having tuned anode and grid circuits, and normally drawing its high-tension supply from a high tension unit, the action of which is controlled by the operating key. The folding operating key, aerial ammeter and tuning lamp are mounted on a metal panel and remain accessible when the cover is closed. High-tension current is supplied from a 30-watt induction coil, which takes 2.3 amps. at 10 volts from an accumulator and supplies 15-20 milliamperes at about 1,000 volts to the transmitting valves. The primary current for the H.T. unit and the heating current for the valve filaments are supplied by the same 10-volt accumulator, 6 volts being tapped off through a resistance for the latter purpose. On pressing the key this resistance is short-circuited, and the full 6 volts are applied to the filaments. A moment later the front stop of the key makes contact and closes the primary circuit of the H.T. unit, causing the latter to operate and supply high-tension current to the valves. The valve grid is connected with an aperiodic grid leak, consisting of a condenser of 0.001 mfd., shunted by a resistance of 6,000 ohms. The tuning of the aerial circuit is effected by means of an inductance tapped off to a 10-point switch, and fine tuning between the steps of the inductance is carried out by means of a spherical variometer coil. For longer wave-lengths, a fixed condenser is connected in parallel with the aerial tuning inductance, and this may be brought into circuit or cut out. The coupling between the aerial and anode circuits is varied by means of a reaction coil. A short and flexible lead named the ""Anode Tap,"" the anodes can be connected with either the aerial end of the aerial-tuning inductance or some other point on this inductance. The change-over switch, which forms part of the transmitter, performs the following operations: in its ""send"" position it connects aerial and earth with the transmitting valve filament circuit, and disconnects the receiver from the low-tension battery; in its ""off"" position it connects the aerial, earth, and low-tension battery from the transmitter and receiver; in its ""receive"" position it connects aerial and earth with the receiver, closes the receiving valve filament circuit and opens the transmitting valve circuit.—In this instructional model the component parts of the continuous wave transmitter, Mark III, are mounted on a wooden baseboard. (c) The receiver is itself a valve oscillator and is so adjusted as to generate continuous oscillations of small amplitude, having a frequency slightly different to that of the incoming oscillations. As a result of this slight difference of frequency, ""beats"" of an audible frequency are produced. These pulses after being amplified by a second valve, arranged for low-frequency amplification, are applied to the head receivers and produce an audible signal. The 60-volt high-tension battery (not shown) fits within a cavity in the left-hand side of the case. The receiver may be used with or without a selector. If the selector is not in use, the aerial, earth and low-tension battery are connected with the receiver by means of the change-over switch. The current from the low-tension battery then flows through the two-valve filaments in parallel and is regulated by an adjustable series resistance. One end of the aerial and earth are connected with the aerial end of the inductance is connected through a fixed condenser, shunted by a resistance of 200,000 ohms, with the grid of the first

The change-over switch, which forms part of the transmitter, performs the following operations: in its ""send"" position it connects aerial and earth with the transmitting valve filament circuit, and disconnects the receiver from the low-tension battery; in its ""off"" position it connects the aerial, earth, and low-tension battery from the transmitter and receiver; in its ""receive"" position it connects aerial and earth with the receiver, closes the receiving valve filament circuit and opens the transmitting valve circuit.—In this instructional model the component parts of the continuous wave transmitter, Mark III, are mounted on a wooden baseboard. (c) The receiver is itself a valve oscillator and is so adjusted as to generate continuous oscillations of small amplitude, having a frequency slightly different to that of the incoming oscillations. As a result of this slight difference of frequency, ""beats"" of an audible frequency are produced. These pulses after being amplified by a second valve, arranged for low-frequency amplification, are applied to the head receivers and produce an audible signal. The 60-volt high-tension battery (not shown) fits within a cavity in the left-hand side of the case. The receiver may be used with or without a selector. If the selector is not in use, the aerial, earth and low-tension battery are connected with the receiver by means of the change-over switch. The current from the low-tension battery then flows through the two-valve filaments in parallel and is regulated by an adjustable series resistance. One end of the aerial and earth are connected with the aerial end of the inductance is connected through a fixed condenser, shunted by a resistance of 200,000 ohms, with the grid of the first valve, the other end being connected with the negative side of the high-tension battery is connected with the positive valve filaments, high-tension positive being connected through the reaction coil, with the outside winding of inter-valve transformer and the junction of a shunt condenser is connected between filament negative and the junction coil with the primary winding of the inter-valve transformer, in order to provide a path for oscillating currents. High-tension positive is also connected through the high-resistance winding of the telephone transformer with the plate of the second (amplifying) valve, the grid of this valve being connected to the secondary winding of the inter-valve transformer with filament negative. The telephone sockets are connected in parallel across the primary of the telephone transformer. (d) Heterodyne Wave-meter.—This wave-meter has a range of wave-lengths from 400 metres to 3,000 metres, and is itself a generator of continuous waves with an oscillating circuit consisting of a reaction coil, variable condenser, and a ""French"" type valve. The inductance and reaction coils are carried in coil boxes, one of which is used for wave lengths of 400 metres to 1,400 metres and the other for wave lengths of 1,200 metres to 3,000 metres. The variable condenser is calibrated with two scales to suit whichever coil is used. Tuning is carried out by means of a variometer. To tune the meter it is necessary to rotate the variable condenser until a silent point is reached, on either side of which ""beats"" at high frequency can be heard. The wave-meter may be used to tune the receiver or transmitter to a definite wave-length or to measure the wave-lengths of received or transmitted waves. (e) Selector and Rectifier.—The selector and rectifier units are optional attachments. They were used separately or in combination to obtain greater freedom from interference. The selector consists of a pair of coils with variable electro-magnetic rotary coupling between them. One of these can be connected across the primary of the inter-valve transformer, and the other has a variable condenser across it and forms part of the receiver circuit. The receiving portion of the set is thereby converted into a two-circuit instrument. The rectifier unit is for converting the alternating high-tension voltage obtained from the vibratory unit into approximately pure D.C. One or, alternatively, two triodes are used in parallel, their grids being connected together and to one terminal of the alternating high-tension supply. The heated filament is connected to one side of a reservoir condenser, the other side of which is connected to the other terminal of the high-tension supply. Half-wave rectification only is obtained by this means, so that the output is not a steady D.C., and contains an undulating component of the same frequency as the source of unrectified voltage, and a considerable lessening of interference was accordingly obtained by the use of this apparatus.","Inv. 1921-117, 122, 123, 124, and 1924-172, 182.","Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

Object entry information: This is a portable military set, designed for use in the forward area for ranges up to 4,000 yards, using a low single wire aerial, suspended at an average height of 3 ft. from the ground. The transmitting group consists of a transmitter Mark III*, a 30-watt high-tension unit and 10-volt, 16-amp. accumulator. The receiving group consists of a Receiver Mark III and selector. (a) *Transmitting Group.*—The transmitter consists essentially of a valve oscillator having tuned anode and grid circuits, and normally drawing its high-tension supply from a high tension unit, the action of which is controlled by the operating key. The folding operating key, aerial ammeter and tuning lamp are mounted on a metal panel and remain accessible when the cover is closed. High-tension current is supplied from a 30-watt induction coil, which takes 2.3 amps. at 10 volts from an accumulator and supplies 15-20 milliamperes at about 1,000 volts to the transmitting valves. The primary current for the H.T. unit and the heating current for the valve filaments are supplied by the same 10-volt accumulator, 6 volts being tapped off through a resistance for the latter purpose. On pressing the key this resistance is short-circuited, and the full 6 volts are applied to the filaments. A moment later the front stop of the key makes contact and closes the primary circuit of the H.T. unit, causing the latter to operate and supply high-tension current to the valves. The valve grid is connected with an aperiodic grid leak, consisting of a condenser of 0.001 mfd., shunted by a resistance of 6,000 ohms. The tuning of the aerial circuit is effected by means of an inductance tapped off to a 10-point switch, and fine tuning between the steps of the inductance is carried out by means of a spherical variometer coil. For longer wave-lengths, a fixed condenser is connected in parallel with the aerial tuning inductance, and this may be brought into circuit or cut out.

Object entry information: This interesting set was designed by the Army Signals Experimental Establishment in 1918 for continuous-wave transmission and reception in place of the light motor quenched gap spark set which preceded it. Rated at 120 watts input, the range of these sets was about 200 miles with a safety factor of 2.
Although not wholly satisfactory, either as regards efficiency or reliability, they represented a distinct advance on previous sets, much ingenuity being shown in the detailed design of the several units as well as in the general lay out.
Power for operating the set was drawn from non-spillable accumulators of 90 ampere-hours capacity. These, together with the set and the aerial equipment, consisting of two 48-ft. masts in sections and a twin aerial of length 300 ft. were carried in a light motor van which also served as office accommodation when the station was erected.
The transmitting apparatus on the left consists of a rotary converter fed from the accumulators and delivering alternating current at 40 volts, 900 cycles. This passes through an auto-transformer with tappings (seen in front of the transmitter) to control the power.
The voltage is now stepped up to 1,400, and is either fed direct to the two transmitting valves (""Tonic Train"") or is first passed through the double-wave rectifier on the right of the transmitter, in which case approximately pure C.W. will be transmitted. The range of wave-lengths is from 600 metres to 2,500 metres.
The receiver (on the right) is of the two-circuit type, the secondary winding being provided with tappings which make it aperiodic when the switch is in the ""stand by"" position. Following the example of the Telefunken Company, this secondary coil is movable about two axes at right angles, so that a very loose coupling can be obtained.
A separate calibrated heterodyne circuit is incorporated in the receiver, and this can be used to tune both transmitter and receiver. For this purpose it is provided with a galvanometer and coupling coil to the transmitter so that resonance therewith may be indicated by the rise in grid current in the heterodyne circuit. A switch enables the operator to include in the grid circuit a condenser and leak resistance whose time period is of audible frequency, and when this is done the receiver can be tuned as from an ordinary buzzer wavemeter.
Detection and note magnification is carried out by means of a separate three-valve detector-amplifier.
A convenient switchboard enables the batteries to be rapidly tested, and the wiring is in all cases carried out by through lengths without joints, all connections or tappings being made at the instrument or switchboard terminals. The whole case is closed by drawing down a roller shutter for protection of the instruments. For transit this is further protected by a canvas-covered panel.

Object entry information: This receiver is similar in general principle to that of the semi-portable 120-watt set. Two circuits are used, the secondary consisting either of a tuned circuit or of an aperiodic coil for quick searching, according to the position of a switch.
The detector and amplifier unit used with this receiver is not shown here, but an example will be found in the amplifier section (C. IV Amplifier). A heterodyne circuit is incorporated in the receiver, and this was used as a wave-meter to tune the transmitter and receiver in addition to its normal function in the reception of continuous-wave signals.
The coupling between the antenna and closed circuits is of the variable withdrawal type. The use of a grid condenser and leak of an acoustic time-period for receiver tuning is described in the label which accompanies the 120-watt field set. (See No. 165.)

Object entry information: Although the value of the discovery made by V. Poulsen in 1902, that the Duddell musical arc could be so modified as to make it suitable for wireless transmission, was immediately recognised, it was not until 1905 that the first experimental transmission were made. Some years later Dr. Lee de Forest applied the Poulsen principle to the construction of a number of small radio-telephone installations which were used in the United States Navy. The early design here shown was evolved by Capt. H. J. Round for the Marconi Company in 1910.
The usual arrangements for burning the arc in an atmosphere of hydrocarbons will be noticed, together with the provision of clockwork as a means of rotating the anode, thereby improving the steadiness of burning.

Object entry information: This interesting set, which was intended for trench warfare use, but which was never issued in quantity, was designed by Capt. L. B. Turner for the unusually low wave-length of 50 metres.
It consists of two units. One of these, the upper ""unit,"" contains the transmitting and receiving triodes and their appropriate oscillatory circuits, and when in use is situated close to the antenna. The ""lower unit"" contains the necessary control apparatus and can be placed anywhere within reasonable distance of these, being connected to the upper unit by a multicore rubber cable.
The high-tension current for transmission is derived from the hand generator or from a battery of dry cells. The transmitter, which is of the choke-control type, has a fixed tuned anode circuit with an aperiodic grid coil. Coupled to these circuits, which are used for reception as well as for transmission, is the antenna circuit which is tuned by means of a semi-adjustable condenser. On account of the low wave-length, and of certain peculiarly troublesome interaction effects which were encountered, the designer found it necessary to insert a coupling condenser of one micro-microfarad capacity between the antenna and closed circuits.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company.
Date of creation: c. 1910
Object entry information: In the early days of radio-telephony, modulation was usually carried out by inserting a microphone directly in the antenna circuit. Since the microphones used in line telephony were only capable of handling a few watts without overheating, many attempts were made to provide others which could deal with heavy currents.
One such specially designed microphone is here exhibited, and was used by Capt. H. J. Round for radio-telephony experiments in 1910.
The problem of handling these large antenna currents was finally met, first by the magnetic amplifier of E. F. W. Alexanderson, and later by the introduction of thermionic methods of control, in which the microphone influences the antenna output through the medium of a chain of amplifying triodes.

By making use of trunk telephone lines, several such gatherings in different towns have been simul-taneously addressed by the same person.
In the case of the Public Address System developed by the Western Electric Company, the apparatus employed comprises a microphone—such as the one exhibited, to pick up the sound of the speaker's voice—a vacuum-tube amplifying arrangement, and one or more loud-speaking telephones to distribute the amplified speech-sounds. Each portion is designed so as to be as nearly distor-tionless as possible over the range of frequencies which constitute speech.
The microphone, is of a type known as the “ push-pull ” type, having two variable resistance elements, one on each side of the diaphragm. The latter is an air-damped steel disc, tensioned so as to have a natural frequency of about 8,000 periods per second. Owing to this high natural frequency and to the fact that it is damped, it responds uniformly to all the frequencies (200–4,000) which occur in normal speech. The two carbon buttons have each a resistance of 100 ohms and are connected in series, the electrical path being from the rear carbon electrode in each case through the carbon granules to a gold-plated area on the diaphragm itself. This double-button construction almost completely eliminates the distortion caused by the non-linear nature of the pressure-resistance characteristics of granular carbon. The microphone is suspended by springs to avoid vibration, and can pick up speech from a distance of five or six feet. On account of its special construction, however, its sensitivity is only about 1/1,000th that of the ordinary telephone transmitter, and this necessitates additional amplification.

Object entry information: The oscillatory currents which are set up in a conductor by the passage of a group of electric waves are incapable of creating an audible sound in an ordinary telephone receiver on account of the frequency, which is too high. By means of a rectifying detector applied to a resonant circuit, however, the telephone receiver may be made responsive to any modulations which are taking place in the waves. These modulations may be introduced at the transmitting station for the purpose of conveying either telephonic or telegraphic signals, and the detector may take several forms. Only two, however, are now in common use, and of these the crystal detector is the simpler, though not the more sensitive. It has been used in various forms for over 16 years, and is very suitable for the reception of wireless telephony over a range of a few miles. The present receiver has been specially designed for this purpose. The receiver consists essentially of a variometer and condenser which can be connected either in series or in parallel by means of a switch ; when attached to an aerial and an earth connection it can be tuned to wave-lengths between 300 and 600 metres. Across this circuit are joined one of two alternative silicon detectors and a pair of telephone receivers. The latter are shunted by a small condenser in order to provide a path for the high-frequency component of the current. When a sensitive point has been found on one of the crystals and the circuit has been brought into resonance with the frequency of current set up by the arriving waves, an oscillating voltage is set up across the terminals of the detector, which owing to thermo-electric and other effects offers more resistance to currents in one direction than in the other. There then flows through the telephones a resultant current whose mean value is not zero and which causes them to give out a sound corresponding to any low-frequency modulations that have been introduced at the transmitter. A diagram of the connections is placed beside the instrument.

Object entry information: This coil, which was designed in 1916, is believed to be the first direction finder to have been taken into the air. Experiments with it were successfully carried out on aircraft in 1917 and the method was immediately adopted by the Air Ministry. Similar experiments carried out on board ship proved equally successful and form the foundation of the development of the present day direction finder. The general principle of the method of determining the direction of an incoming wireless signal by means of a rotating closed coil may be briefly described as follows:— A flat rectangular coil is suspended with its plane vertical in such a manner that it is capable of rotating about a vertical axis. The coil is connected to a tuning condenser to form a closed oscillatory circuit, and leads from the condenser are taken to the usual form of detecting receiver. When the circuit is tuned to the frequency of the incoming electro-magnetic waves, an oscillatory current is induced of sufficient strength under favourable circumstances to give audible signals in the telephone receiver. The magnitude of this current is dependent upon the angle between the axis of the coil and the direction of the transmitting station. A simple consideration of the magnetic field associated with the incoming waves shows that when the axis of the coil points towards the transmitting station, the intensity of the received waves is a minimum. By rotating the coil, therefore, the minimum position, and hence the direction of the arriving waves can be determined. There is with the type of frame under consideration an ambiguity of 180°, since no indication is given as to whether the bearing of the transmitting station is (x) or (x + 180°), but this ambiguity is removed where direction-finding stations work in pairs on the ground.

Object name: EXPERIMENTAL RADIO-GONIOMETER.
Maker/Donor: Invented by M. Bellini. Lent by Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company.
Date of creation: 1907 (System patented).
Object entry information: This is an experimental radio-goniometer used by the inventor, M. Bellini, for directive wireless transmission. The British patent for this system, which has been very widely employed, was filed by Messrs Bellini & Tosi in 1907. In this system a pair of nearly closed triangular coils are fixed at right angles, and coils capable of being inserted in their lower portions, also at right angles. A third coil, which is missing from this original model, is placed close to, and within, the other two coils just mentioned, and forms part of the closed transmitting circuit. This third coil is capable of being rotated so as to be parallel with either of the fixed coils, or else occupy some intermediate position. It is found that the maximum intensity of radiation from the pair of antennæ is greatest in the direction of the plane of the primary inducing coil. The complementary apparatus for directional reception is identical with that described above, except that receiving and not transmitting apparatus is connected to the primary coil, which in this case is called the "" search"" coil. There are two other methods of radio-telegraphic direction finding which are widely employed at the present time; one of them is described under No. 181.

Presented by Sanders Brothers.,1923,"This alternating current rectifier operates by gaseous conduction in helium between cold electrodes. There is no filament, and the tube is capable of handling 100 m.A. at 1,000 volts, with a working life of 3,000 hours and upwards. The tube in the form here shown was developed by the American Radio & Research Corporation in the spring of 1923. The cathode, which consists of a hollow carbon cup, is held in position by means of a spring clip. The anode, formed of a small carbon button, is placed opposite a hole in the cathode. By means of shields all paths between anode and cathode, except that through the hole, are made shorter than the mean free path of ions at the gas pressure employed, so that conduction along these paths is not possible. Considering the behaviour of the tube when an alternating potential is applied, during the half cycles when the hollow electrode is negative the tube conducts, and the space between the electrodes becomes filled with a cloud of positive ions and electrons. Positive ions dropping from the cloud on to the inner surface of the hollow cathode liberate electrons. These proceed towards the anode and on their way ionize neutral gas molecules to form new positive ions, so that the discharge is maintained. The original electrons and those formed by ionization nearly all pass out sooner or later through the hole in the cathode, and thus reach the anode, which is solid. They do this rapidly and easily owing to their mobility, which allows them to speed up more quickly than the heavy positive ions, so conduction in this direction occurs with facility. For the reverse direction the solid electrode is the cathode, and positive ions under this condition will wander out from the hollow space through the holes and impinge on the solid electrode. Progress is slow, for they are large and heavy, and the gradient of the field up inside the cloud is weak, consequently conduction is very small in this reverse direction.

Object entry information: Two specimens of this type of variable condenser are shown. One of them has been taken apart in order to display the action. The use of mica in a variable condenser makes for compactness, since the specific inductive capacity of mica is roughly seven times that of air, and it is upon this that the capacity of two opposing surfaces of given area depends. The condenser plates, of which there are two, consist of sheets of copper foil mounted on resilient material and separated by sheets of mica. The condenser plates are always kept parallel and are urged apart by means of tongues bent out from a springy metal sheet inserted between the plates. By rotating the knob attached to the spindle the support of the lower plate is urged away from or towards the upper plate by virtue of the screw thread cut on the spindle.

Object entry information: The condenser, of which an experimental element and photographs are shown, was built for the Government medium-power arc station at Northolt. All the radial elements are connected in parallel by means of peripheral plates and a central busbar. Partly owing to this symmetrical construction, which equalises the load, there were no measurable losses in this condenser. The method of construction adopted enables the non-earthy terminal of the condenser to remain without special insulating precautions, since the necessary insulation is afforded by the dielectric itself.

Object entry information: During the War of 1914–18 it was found that the development of valve amplifiers made it possible to overhear telephone conversations or buzzer signals at distances of as much as two or three thousand yards from the line on which the signals were passing. This was effected by picking up the minute earth or induction currents, or both, on special circuits laid out in “no man’s land,” and then passing them through audio-frequency amplifiers. In order to prevent overhearing by the enemy, buzzer screening circuits of the type exhibited were laid out in an unbroken line along the front, their purpose being to set up vigorous audio-frequency currents in the earth which should create in enemy listening apparatus loud continuous or intermittent buzzing sounds through which the signals or conversations could not be read. The arrangement proved highly successful in practice, though the impossibility of obtaining definite information of its efficacy in any given case made it necessary to take other precautions as well.

It was developed particularly for use at Babylon shore station, near New York, in 1904, where jamming from other stations was very severe, and its use was found to enable this station to transact messages with ship stations which had previously been impossible. The apparatus, which was used by Marconi in conjunction with his magnetic detector (see No. 33), consists essentially of three acceptor circuits arranged in series. (In this instance the circuits are arranged for tune ""A"" reception on 60 metres wave-length.) Earth connections are taken to each of the three inductances at tapping points which are nodes of potential at this wave-length; hence they do not take energy from the receiving circuit. When signals of the desired frequency are received they are able to actuate the detector in the ordinary way, but if disturbances of any other frequency arrive they do not go through the receiver circuit, but pass to earth at the nodal tapping points.

Object entry information: Four power buzzers of different makes are shown. One is of French design, one is a British instrument, and the remaining two are of German make. The object of all such instruments is to provide a means of signalling between two points without any intervening wire or conventional wireless link. (See ""Buzzer-Amplifier Set,"" No. 194.) Apart from the interest arising from their development and use in the War of 1914–18, it is worthy of notice that many experimenters from 1846 onwards have taken advantage of the conductivity of the soil in order to transmit messages. It was natural that with the exalted sensitivity conferred on receivers by the invention of the thermionic valve the same measures should again be resorted to in time of war, in cases where aerials would be too conspicuous and cables destroyed by shell-fire. 1. The Parleur power buzzer was designed for the French Military Service. It is a spark induction coil of special design, taking primary current at a pressure of from 10 to 20 volts. The laminated armature nearly closes the V-shaped gap between the poles of the core, the air space being only about 0.25 mm. The armature is bolted to a stiff steel spring which carries one of the interrupter contacts on a thin projecting plate. The mechanical frequency of the interruptions is determined by the stiffness and inertia of the spring, and is arranged to be some 800 periods per second. The interrupter contacts are shunted by a 4-mfd. condenser. If the resistance of the earth connections is 200 ohms the secondary current is 0.2 amperes with 20 watts input. 2. The British design is similar to the foregoing. It was provided with three alternative armatures having frequencies of 640, 730 and 540 periods per second. 3. This German power buzzer has an oscillating armature arranged so that an alternating voltage is induced in the secondary winding and not a pulsating voltage as in the previous examples. A small incandescent lamp serves as a rough indication of the secondary earth current. 4. This is a more elaborate German instrument with two alternative buzzers, a safety fuse, and a switch to regulate the power.

The set includes a buzzer for transmission and a three-valve amplifier C, Mark III, for reception.

Three different bases may be connected with the com- mutator and the desired base connected to either the buzzer or amplifier by means of a change-over switch.

Object name: ""WIRED WIRELESS"" SETS.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: Designed by Capt. H. P. T. Lefroy, R.E. in 1915.
Object entry information: These sets were designed by Capt. H. P. T. Lefroy, R.E. The term ""wired wireless"" has been used to describe a system of multiplex electrical communication based on the use of one or more high-frequency carrier currents which are transmitted along wires or cables in the form of telegraph or telephone signals. Although some of the principles underlying such a system were already known it was not until 1910 that General G. O. Squier, of the United States Army, pointed out the practicable possibilities and described experiments made with high-frequency alternators. He also constructed portable buzzer-operated sets for field use, but, owing to the large attenuation constant inherent in the wave length used, 1,100 metres, the range of these sets was not great. Following on preliminary experiments in 1914, Capt. Lefroy, in 1915, designed for the British Army Signal Service a series of ""wired wireless"" sets working at four different frequencies which could be operated simultaneously on a normal telephone line, thus providing four extra channels of high-frequency communication. Two of these sets, which were used at the battle of Loos, are exhibited. They contain fundamental improvements, in that adjustments of the carrier frequency are effected independently of the line constants; while the frequencies are so chosen that a reduction in attenuation corresponding to a tenfold increase of range is obtained. A value of coupling was chosen to give the greatest strength of signals compatible with absence of interference from other sources. The later developments of carrier-current telegraphy and telephony for non-military use have been very rapid, chiefly owing to the use of triodes, and to progress in the design of filter circuits for separating the various high-frequency currents; thus, in April, 1923, there were in operation, between Pittsburgh and Chicago, 128 full duplex channels of communication, based on three carrier-current circuits. The four sets designed were given frequencies corresponding to wave lengths of 4,000, 8,000, 16,000 and 32,000 metres, and were known as A, B, C and D sets respectively, of which the B and C sets are shown. The range of the D set on a single open wire was 40 miles. From the diagram it will be seen that a closed oscillatory circuit, energised by a battery and vibrator, is inductively coupled to an acceptor circuit which is connected to the line and earth. This acceptor circuit is known as a ""tuned link,"" and it is important to notice that in operation it is permanently tuned to the same frequency as the closed circuit, regardless of the line constants. The same oscillatory circuits are used, both for transmission and reception, the necessary connections being made by means of contacts on the signalling key.

Two relays are shown fitted in a wooden case, together with transformers and a 6-volt battery. Both relays may be cut out of the telephone and receiver circuit, or one or both may be connected into it by means of a switch. Each relay consists of a permanent magnet with pole pieces on which two coils, connected into the receiver circuit, are wound. A steel reed vibrates in front of the poles of the magnet and is attached to one carbon electrode of a granular carbon microphone, the microphone chamber with the back electrode being held stationary. The microphone is joined in series with the local battery, the primary of the transformer, and an intensifying coil wound on the limbs of the magnet. The vibrations of the reed acting upon the carbon granules in the microphone cause telephonic changes of the current in the local circuit, which are intensified by the action of the intensifying coils and flow through the primary of the transformer. Currents are therefore induced in the secondary of the transformer, which act on the telephone receivers, or flow through the magnet coils of a second relay, according to the number of relays being used.

Object entry information: These relays, which were patented in 1911 by Mr. S. G. Brown, are used to magnify receiver circuit currents so that messages may be printed on a tape machine or otherwise recorded, and very faint signals rendered audible. Two relays are shown fitted in a wooden case, together with transformers and a 6-volt battery. Both relays may be cut out of the telephone and receiver circuit, or one or both may be connected into it by means of a switch. Each relay consists of a permanent magnet with pole pieces on which two coils, connected into the receiver circuit, are wound. A steel reed vibrates in front of the poles of the magnet and is attached to one carbon electrode of a granular carbon microphone, the microphone chamber with the back electrode being held stationary. The microphone is joined in series with the local battery, the primary of the transformer, and an intensifying coil wound on the limbs of the magnet. The vibrations of the reed acting upon the carbon granules in the microphone cause telephonic changes of the current in the local circuit, which are intensified by the action of the intensifying coils and flow through the primary of the transformer. Currents are therefore induced in the secondary of the transformer, which act on the telephone receivers, or flow through the magnet coils of a second relay, according to the number of relays being used.

Object entry information: This telephone receiver, patented by S. G. Brown, is one of the most sensitive in use. Instead of the ordinary flat diaphragm there is a flexible steel reed to which is attached a thin conical diaphragm. The steel reed has one end fixed, while the other extends over the pole pieces of the magnet; it is cut away slightly at the sides, and can thus be adjusted to have a natural frequency of about 800 periods per second, which has been found the most satisfactory for wireless telegraphic purposes.

It was used for this purpose up to the end of 1915, but superior accuracy has since been obtained by the multi-vibrateur method. The complete instrument consists of two parts:— (A). A wavemeter (not shown). (B). Photographic apparatus for photographing spark trains, generated in the main oscillatory circuit by means of a gap and by help of a rotating mirror. (A) The wavemeter consisted of a variable condenser (from 100 to 900 m.mfd.) of special design, having a direct-reading scale, reading 1 in 1000 at the lower end, and 1 in 200 at the upper, carefully tested, and found by Maxwell's Commutator Method to be uniform. Three inductance coils were used, wound on ebonite formers, of stranded 7/36 wire, and having terminals removed 18.5 cm. from the centre of the coils to avoid interference from the condenser plates. A Duddell thermo-ammeter of 1.5 ohms resistance completed the coil-condenser circuit, and the point of maximum resonance was obtained by observing the point of maximum deflection. The wavemeter was very loosely coupled with the oscillatory circuit of the testing apparatus. (B). A small alternator of variable frequency (50 to 200 periods per sec.) was connected through a small high voltage transformer to a spark gap, having cadmium electrodes, shunted by a glass plate condenser, and a bare wire inductance in oil. A large variable air condenser could be put in parallel with the glass plate condenser, and by varying the capacity and inductance in circuit, oscillations of frequencies from 300,000 to 1,200,000 periods per sec. could be obtained. The special camera, which forms the exhibit, is mounted on a long slab of sandstone for rigidity. A rotating mirror was fixed on a vertical axis at one end, and driven by a small motor, the speed of which was kept constant by means of a commutator mounted on the axis. This was connected with a bridge battery and galvanometer for measuring capacity; by applying a light variable brake to the axis, the galvanometer light spot could be kept at zero, when the speed remained steady (usually about 60 r.p.m.). The other end of the camera has two branches which carry respectively the spark electrodes and means for allowing the plate carrier to be smoothly raised and lowered, whilst the rotating mirror throws the image of the spark trains as streaks upon the plate. By measurement the average distance from spark to spark was found, enabling the frequency to be calculated, taking into account the distance between the mirror and plate and the speed of rotation of the mirror. The mean of 5 to 10 spark train photographs showed an average variation giving an accuracy of 1/1000.",Inv. 1925-1.,"Continuation from previous page: [TRUE]

Object entry information: This is a portable wavemeter consisting of a coil wound on a cardboard former, connected in parallel with a continuously variable air condenser, mounted on an ebonite panel. The arrangement can be tuned to wave-lengths ranging from 300 to 900 metres. If the switch is put to “λ 100–300,” some of the turns of the coil are short-circuited, thus decreasing the range of wave-lengths. The panel is provided with clips for holding a helium tube which glows when the meter is in resonance with as adjacent transmitter, a sharp indication being obtained if loose coupling is employed.

Object name: GERMAN WAVEMETER.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. C. Lorentz. Lent by The Institution of Electrical Engineers.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a wavemeter designed with three different arrangements of coils for wave-lengths ranging from 100 to 6,200 metres. With the two-way switch at “Summer” (Buzzer), the wavemeter can be used for transmission purposes, a small dry cell (not shown) being included in series with the buzzer. With the switch at “Zelle,” the detector cell is connected in series with the telephones in place of the battery and buzzer, and the receiver can then be tuned to the wave-length of the incoming signals by the adjustment of the condenser. The correct wave-length is read off from a chart supplied with the set.

Object name: STATION TESTER MARK II.
Maker/Donor: Lent by The War Office.
Date of creation: Made during the War of 1914–18
Object entry information: This is a wavemeter made during the War of 1914–18 arranged in a small and portable form, so that it can be used for tuning and testing transmitters or receivers. It consists of a closed oscillatory circuit having a continuously variable air condenser and a fixed inductance coil. With the right-hand double-pole two-way switch at the “send” position, the buzzer with its battery is connected across the oscillatory circuit and energises it by a process of shock excitation. With the switch at “receive,” the battery and buzzer are replaced by a carborundum crystal detector and telephones so that the wavemeter acts as a receiver, and will respond to, and measure the wave length of, a transmitting circuit in its vicinity. The left-hand switch allows any one of three coils of varying inductances to be used, thus extending the range of the instrument.
