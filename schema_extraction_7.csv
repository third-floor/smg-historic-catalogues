0,PROPOSED FLYING MACHINE.,Inv. 1907-29. S.M. 312. L.S.,Whole,N/A,PROPOSED FLYING MACHINE.,donated,PROPOSED FLYING MACHINE. (Scale 1: 7.),"This model, the design for which was patented in 1842 by Mr. W. S. Henson, was built in 1844-5 by Messrs. Henson and J. Stringfellow. Henson's proposal to utilise the fixed surfaces of an aeroplane to obtain support from the air was regarded at the time as a possible solution of the problem of flight. Henson's idea was to imitate soaring birds, all previous attempts being based on vibrating or rotating surfaces, after the manner of flapping wings. It was intended that the actual machine should be used as a conveyer of letters, goods, and passengers. The model consists of an extended surface or aeroplane of oiled silk or canvas, stretched upon a bamboo frame made rigid by trussing, both above and below. A car is attached to the under side of the aeroplane to contain the steam engine, passengers, etc. It has three wheels to run freely upon when it reaches earth. Two propellers, 3 ft. diameter, are shown with their blades set at 45 degrees; they are operated by endless cords from the steam engine (see No. 40). Behind these is a fan-shaped tail, stretched upon a triangular frame capable of being opened out, closed, or moved up and down by means of cords and pulleys. By this latter arrangement ascent or descent was to be accomplished. A rudder for steering sideways is placed under the tail, and above the main aeroplane a sail (not shown) was to be stretched between two masts rising from the car, to assist in maintaining the course. When in motion the front edge of the machine was to be raised in order to obtain the required air support. To start the model it was proposed to allow it to run down an incline, e.g., the side of a hill, the propellers being first set in motion. The velocity gained in the descent was expected to sustain it in its further progress, the engine overcoming the head resistance when in full flight. Experiments were eventually made on the downs, near Chard, and the night trials were abandoned, as the silk became saturated from a deposit of dew. After many day trials, down wide, inclined rails, the model was found to be deficient in stable equilibrium for open-air experiments, little puffs of wind or ground currents being sufficient to destroy the balance. The actual machine was never constructed, but in 1847-48 J. Stringfellow built a model which is supposed to be the first flying machine which performed a successful flight.

5,WEISS MODEL GLIDER.,1912-102,Whole,N/A,,donated,WEISS MODEL GLIDER,"Presented by The Weiss Aeroplane and Launcher Syndicate, Ltd., London, E.C. 1912. This model glider is a development of one shown at Paris in 1905 by Mr. José Weiss, and patented by him in 1908 in Great Britain. It was designed with a view to obtain automatic stability. The glides were made from the top of a hill in a direction directly opposed to that of the wind, and it is stated that the gliding speed of the model in relation to the atmosphere was between 30 and 35 miles per hour. The glider is a monoplane constructed on the lines of the albatross, and the framework consists of bamboo, the joints being made with tire cement and tarred twine. The main wings possess, at the middle, considerable thickness, and taper towards the tips, where they are flexible and flat. They are characterised by a distinct change of angle of incidence from the fuselage to the tip. Near the body the angle is greatest and is about 5 degrees, and from here it gradually decreases towards the wing tip. The tips themselves are upturned in such a way that they present a marked negative angle of incidence. A tail is provided, and, in the model, which was launched by hand, a roll of lead formed the weight, which was slipped over a vertical rod at the junction of the main frame with the landing skids, in a position corresponding to the breast of a bird. It is claimed that the design of the glider gives it a large amount of automatic stability, both longitudinal and lateral, and much experimental work has been carried out near Arundel with this and subsequent man-carrying gliders. The power-driven machine constructed in 1910 on the lines of the model had a total sustaining surface of 185 sq. ft., with a span of 34 ft., and weighed, with the pilot, 750 lb. A notable feature of this machine was the absence of cross-bracing, the compression and tension members being both provided for by the bamboo triangulated framework. Lashings of tarred string were employed as on the gliders. The tail of the machine combined the functions both of elevator and rudder, and there was no control of the wings themselves in the hands of the pilot. An eight-cylinder E.N.V. engine of about 30 h.p. was fitted and drove a single tractor screw of 7 ft. diameter. Inv. 1912-102. S.M. 1402.

Wright on the racecourse of Hunaudières, near Le Mans, in the autumn of 1908. It consists of two horizontal superposed planes, nearly rectangular in plan, the greater length being in a direction at right angles to the line of flight. At the rear is a double vertical rudder for steering in a lateral direction, and in front of the main planes two smaller superposed horizontal planes serve to control the vertical flight path of the machine. These front and rear rudders are nearly balanced, so that they can be easily moved by the control levers. The small semi-circular plane between the elevators is connected with the rear rudders, and is designed to act exclusively as a tell-tale. The aeroplane is mounted upon two wooden runners or skids, which extend forward and form supports for the front rudder. The whole structure is braced with wooden struts and wire ropes, the vertical wooden struts between the main planes being spaced at about 6 ft. intervals. The planes are constructed of cotton fabric, stretched over ribbed frames; in the model the port sides of the planes and the port rudder are uncovered in order to show the construction of the framing. Two seats are shown, that on the left is for the aviator, the other one being for a passenger or pupil. Only two levers are used by Mr. Wilbur Wright, one on either side, the one on his left being duplicated on the right-hand side of the passenger. The left-hand lever controls the front rudder only, whilst the other one has two controls.

Santos-Dumont rose from the ground in the record time of 6·2 secs., and attained the high speed of 60 miles per hour in free flight. fabric which encloses the spars and bamboo ribs is double, and is formed of silk. The leading and trailing edges of the planes are quite sharp, and are supported by wires held in claws at the ends of the bamboo ribs. The fabric envelops the wire at the leading edge, but at the trailing edge it is laced to the wire, thus ensuring that the wings are stretched tightly. The greatest camber of the planes is slightly in front of the centre and is approximately 4 in. The tail is built up of fabric stretched on a bamboo frame, and moves as a whole about a universal joint formed at the after end of the chassis. The lever on the right hand of the aviator elevates or depresses the tail, while the steering wheel moves it sideways, both the motions being controlled by steel wires kept taut by springs. The lever at the back of the aviator controls the warping or flexing of the wings; it is attached at its upper end to his coat, so that by leaning over sideways in either direction the wings are warped as required. The aviator sits beneath the engine, on a strip of canvas stretched between the two lower bamboos of the main frame. The engine represented is a twin-cylinder Darracq motor of 25-30 h.p. The cylinders are placed horizontally on opposite sides of the crank-case, and are 130 mm. (5·12 in.) diam. by 120 mm. (4·72 in.) stroke. The engine is coupled directly to the propeller, which acts as a flywheel. Water-cooling is employed, and the radiator, consisting of numerous small copper pipes, is placed beneath the main plane on each side. The water enters the tubes from the cylinders at the top, and after traversing them is pumped back again. The weight of the engine is taken at the centre by the central bamboo, and at the cylinder ends by the transverse spars of the main planes, which are themselves supported at these points by oval steel struts connected with the chassis. In addition, two tie rods connect the engine at the rear with the top bamboo of the main frame. The petrol tank is placed above the motor, and is shown on the model, but the water tank, which is also placed above the motor, is not represented.

The type of monoplane represented, which, in Germany, is known by the name of “Rumpler” or “Rumpler-Taube,” and in Austria by the name of “Etrich,” was designed by Etrich and Wels in 1908. The machine then built, named the “Etrich Wels III,” was very similar to the modern Etrich monoplane, so successful in Austria, excepting that it had a front elevating plane that has since been removed. Both in Austria and in Germany this type of monoplane is greatly relied upon for military purposes, and many fine flights stand to its credit in both countries. With a Rumpler monoplane Hirth won the first German reliability competition, and in 1911 flew from Munich to Berlin with the same type of machine. The entire construction is on similar lines to those adopted by Lilienthal in his glider, and, on account of the general resemblance of the machine to a bird it was often called “Taube” or “pigeon.” The main frame of the machine consists of a central fuselage built of wood and entirely enclosed. It is of trapezoidal section at the front, where it affords accommodation for seats for the pilot and passenger tandem fashion. At the rear of the frame the transverse section changes into a triangular one. The supporting planes are shaped like a bird's wings, and the entire rear edge is flexible. The trailing edges of each plane or wings are curved upward at the tips, and this construction is stated to give great automatic stability. The two wings are set at a small dihedral angle. The main bracing of the wings consists of a single girder built of wood, placed laterally under the planes. The latter are braced by a large number of stay wires, both above and below, and the method followed is similar to that adopted by Lilienthal. The tail of the machine, which resembles that of a bird, extends from the after end of the fuselage, and consists of a horizontal and two vertical surfaces. The control for the horizontal portion of the tail, i.e. the elevator, is by means of a column or vertical lever pivoted at its base to move backward and forward. A forward push away from the pilot turns the tail down and elevates the machine. The rudder consists of two triangular surfaces, one above and one below the elevator, and is operated by pedals. Warping of the wings is accomplished by wire and pulley connections to a steering wheel mounted on the control column. The landing chassis is of the Blériot type, and consists of two bicycle wheels at the front of the machine, together with a rear skid. The wheels, except in the military type, can be steered while the running over the ground. Power is supplied by a four-cylinder, water-cooled motor of 70 h.p., built in the front of the fuselage, the radiators being on each side of the latter. Inv. 1913-442. S.M. 353.

Philipp Spandow, Ltd. 1913 The model represents the Wright passenger biplane of 1911, which resembles closely the “Baby” Wright machine of 1910, designed especially for high speed. The machine differs in several essential points from the original Wright design, and a most noticeable departure consists in placing the monoplane elevator at the rear of the machine, where it forms part of the tail. The double elevator which was formerly at the front of the machine disappears entirely, and there are merely a pair of small surfaces, situated above and on the skids, fulfilling the same purpose as the half-moon shaped planes fitted between the front elevating planes in the earlier design. These surfaces tend to make the machine sensitive to movements of the rudder. The second important departure from the standard practice is the control, known as the Orville Wright control. The left-hand lever operates the simple elevator as previously, but it is fitted with a friction brake which automatically locks the lever in any desired position. The movements of the right-hand lever differ in their result entirely from those of the corresponding lever of the earlier design. A fore-and-aft movement of the lever warps the wing tips, and also moves the rudder, both these movements being obtained simultaneously. In addition to these movements the handle of the lever is hinged, and can be moved sideways by a wrist movement independently of the lever itself. The handle is connected by means of a bell-crank lever and rod with a free quadrant on the operating rock-shaft, the quadrant being connected with the rudder. Another similar quadrant on the operating rock-shaft connected with the wing tips is rigidly attached to the lever itself, and when the lever is moved to and fro both quadrants rotate, the free disc then becoming locked to the lever by a stiff spring. The engine fitted is of the N.A.G. (Neue Automobile Gesellschaft) type, having four cylinders mounted on an aluminium crank-case. It is capable of developing 55 h.p. at 1,603 revolutions per minute. On the continent this type of engine was much used, especially for military aeroplanes.

The machine shown is his only biplane now remaining, and is the actual one which flew over Cambridge during the military manœuvres of September, 1912. It is practically identical in design with its predecessor, with which Mr. Cody won the military competition in the previous August. The aeroplane which was used by Mr. Cody when he met with a fatal accident in August, 1913, was similar in general features to these machines, but the divided elevator shown was replaced by a single elevator, and floats were substituted for the landing chassis in order to convert the machine into a hydro-aeroplane. One of the chief features of the machine shown is the divided front elevator, the two portions of which are capable of being warped in unison with the warping control of the main planes, as well as of being employed as an ordinary single elevator. The elevators are carried at their ends by long bamboo outriggers fastened to the ends of the struts between the main planes, and at the centre by outriggers carried to the landing chassis, and to the centre of the upper plane. There is no rear elevator. The tail, which is supported by long outriggers, consists of twin rudders, together with a pair of small fixed horizontal planes that serve as damper planes and help to preserve the longitudinal stability of the machine. Control is effected by means of a universally-pivoted rod with a hand-wheel top, the feet being entirely free. This rod is free to move either laterally or fore-andaft, as well as to rotate on its axis. The last-named movement is used to control the rudders; the fore-and-aft movement of the lever controls the elevators acting as one, whilst the lateral motion operates the warping mechanism, the rudders and the differential movement of the elevators. The steering wheel is used for separate rudder control when turning. Immediately behind the pilot's seat is a passenger seat, whilst two other passenger seats were sometimes placed behind the pilot, but outside the "" nacelle."" The landing chassis is of heavy construction, and consists of a long stout central skid carrying a small pair of wheels in front, together with a larger pair situated in front of and under the main planes. These wheels are mounted on vertical telescopic tubes with spring shock absorbers; the wheel track is 3.5 ft. gauge. Small wheels are fitted as fenders to the wing tips. In the construction of the machine silver spruce was used for the spars and struts, hickory for the landing chassis, and bamboo bound with tape for the outriggers. The motor, which was of the six-cylinder Austrian Daimler type of 120 h.p., was carried on bearers placed on a platform supported from the chassis by diagonal struts.

This twin-engined biplane, which is inherently stable, was originally designed as a heavy bomber, and was slightly modified to enable it to accommodate sufficient fuel for the trans-Atlantic flight. The centre section of the main planes, which is horizontal, carries the two engines, each of which is enclosed, with its radiator and an oil tank, in a casing of approximately stream-line form, and supported between the wings by four vertical circular steel struts with wooden fairings. A service petrol tank is fitted in the centre section of the upper plane. The main planes on each side of the centre section have a dihedral angle of 3 degrees, and are set to an angle of incidence of 3½ degrees. The spars, which are of box section, are built up of spruce and three-ply and bound with fabric, while the interplane struts, with the exception of those carrying the engines, are of solid spruce. The upper and lower wings are of equal span and carry balanced ailerons. The fuselage is constructed in two parts, the forward portion ahead of the main plane rear spars being of steel tube, while the longerons of the rear portion are of McGruer’s patent wooden tube, and are braced with swaged steel tie-rods. The two seats are arranged side by side, immediately behind a large petrol tank, in the nose of the machine. The tail, which is fitted with two balanced rudders and two fins, is of biplane form, each plane being set at an angle of 2½ degrees with the axis of the fuselage, and fitted with an elevator in the rear.

Humber, Ltd., Coventry, was used extensively towards the end of the war (1914–1918). It is a nine-cylinder rotary air-cooled engine, the cylinders of which are of aluminium shrunk on to cast-iron liners, and arranged radially round a fixed crank-shaft. Each cylinder is provided at its lower end with five shallow stiffening ribs, above which is a series of deep radiating fins. The combustion heads, which are of machined steel, are made in one piece with the induction pockets, into which steel inlet valve guides are pressed, while the exhaust valve cages, into which cast-iron valve guides are pressed, are also in one piece with the heads. The cylinders and combustion heads are attached to the crank-case by four long bolts located at the corners of each cylinder, the cooling fins being cut away to allow clearance. The pistons are of aluminium alloy, have slightly concave heads, and are provided with five very shallow cast-iron rings set in grooves near the top of the piston. Holes are drilled in the piston skirt to allow the oil from inside the piston to escape on to the cylinder walls. The connecting-rods are of tubular section steel, and, with the exception of the master-rod, are bushed with phosphor bronze at both ends. The master rod is bushed with phosphor bronze at the piston end only, its large end riding on two ball-bearings mounted on the crank-pin. Inlet and exhaust valves are both operated by overhead rocker arms and tappets, each of which is connected to a push rod by a ball joint. The cam gear comprises two internally toothed rings known as “gear rings,” within which are the corresponding externally toothed gears. These gears have 16 teeth as against 18 of the “gear rings,” and the gears are thus driven at nine-eighths of engine speed, and overtake the gear rings once in eight revolutions. Each gear has four cams, so that in eight revolutions each tappet is lifted four times, i.e., once in every two revolutions. Forced lubrication is fitted, and oil from the pump is led to an orifice in the crank-shaft, through which it is conducted by a copper pipe to a duct in the base of the rear web of the hollow crank-pin. A bye-pass at the foot of the rear crank-pin supplies oil to the thrust box. The bulk of the oil forced along the pipe inside the crank-shaft travels up the duct in the rear web to the crank-pin, where the stream diverges again into supplies for the connecting-rod assembly, the pistons and the cylinders on the one hand, and for the cam gear-box on the other hand. The Blœctube carburetter is screwed on the extreme rear end of the hollow crank-shaft, through which the explosive mixture passes to the orifice at the foot of the rear web of the crank, whence it passes into the main crank-case. It is then sucked through a ring of holes into the gas chamber, which rotates with the thrust box and through the induction pipes, into the cylinders. Ignition is provided by two M.L. magnetos of the revolving armature type, giving two sparks per revolution. The principal data of the engine are: Normal b.h.p., 150; weight (dry), 408 lb.; normal revolutions per minute, 1,250; bore, 120 mm.; stroke, 170 mm.; petrol consumption, 13 gallons per hour; oil consumption, 1.5 gallons per hour; order of firing, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8.

High-tensile steel connecting-rods, machined to H section, connect with the six-cylinder seven-bearing type crank-shaft, the cranks of which are spaced 120 degrees apart. The crank-case is in two portions, the upper portion, which is stiffened by cross webs, is formed integral with the housings of the crank-shaft bearings, and carries the eight supporting feet of the engine, in addition to the main lubrication filter and two breathers. The lower half acts as an oil sump and a cover for the moving parts, and is furnished with sharply inclined gutters, which ensure that the filter remains constantly submerged in oil. Lubrication is by means of two pumps, driven by a vertical shaft, which operates the whole of the accessories. The upper pump draws oil from an external tank, and forces it by way of a filter into a manifold, which, by means of branch pipes, supplies oil to the journal bearings, the thrust housing, the vertical shaft, and the skew gearing operating the magnetos. Oil fed to the main crank-shaft bearings passes into the hollow journals, and by way of holes drilled in the crank-webs, to the crank pins, whence it is flung on to the cylinder walls and the little ends of the connecting-rods. From the front end of the manifold a small pipe conveys oil through the hollow cam-shaft to the cam-shaft bearings, when it is flung on to the cams, rocking levers, and valve heads. Oil which collects in the base of the chamber is drawn out by the second pump and delivered back to the oil tank. Two independent sparking plugs are fitted in each cylinder, one set being connected to a Fellows E.M. 6 type magneto, the second set being served by a small six-volt battery, through a Remy combined contact breaker and distributer mounted at the rear end of the cam-shaft housing, and a coil carried on other magneto platform. Two Zenith carburetters are fitted.

In this type of motor the crank-shaft is stationary, and the cylinders and crank-chamber revolve round it. The example shown, which has been removed from the ""Birdling"" monoplane (see No. 17), has nickel-steel cylinders 4.3 in. diameter by 4.7 in. stroke, machined with their air-cooling ribs out of the solid. The crank-chamber is also of steel, and the seven cylinders are held in position by split-steel rings, which are sprung into grooves turned in the cylinders, so that the cylinders cannot be withdrawn without removing the rings. Taper-pins of special section, which pass through the rim of the crank-chamber, securely lock these rings in position. Piston-rings of L-section brass are employed, similar in shape to the cup-leather of an hydraulic piston. The end plate, on which the propeller is fixed when used, as in the example, as a tractor screw, carries on the inside the cams and gear-wheels which operate the exhaust valve rods. Ball-bearings are used to support the engine as a whole upon the stationary crank-shaft, and a thrust block is provided at the rear end of the engine. The connecting-rods all operate on a single crank-pin. The big end of one of them, embracing the crank and mounted on ball-bearings, is formed into a cage, the outer rings of which carry the plain bearings for the remaining six connecting-rods. The carburetter, which is stationary, is of the single-jet type, and feeds the engine through the hollow crank-shaft, petrol flowing thence into the crank-chamber, from which each cylinder obtains its mixture by means of an automatic inlet valve of the mushroom type situated in the piston-head. The valve seating also acts as a means of connection between the piston and the connecting-rod. The exhaust valves are situated in the cylinder heads, and are operated by twin balanced rocking levers actuated by long push rods connected with the cams contained in the end plate of the crank-chamber. The cams consist of seven flat steel collars with a common boss keyed on to a spindle and operated by an epicyclic train of wheels, the fixed wheel being on the end of the stationary crank-shaft. Both the inlet and the exhaust valves are balanced against centrifugal force by means of counterweights. An odd number of cylinders is necessary in order that the firing of the mixture in each cylinder may be carried out at equal angular intervals, and thus give an even torque, e.g., if the mixture in cylinder No. 1 was fired first, the order of firing would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, and repeat. Ignition is effected by a Bosch high-tension magneto, mounted on a stationary bracket in an inverted position and driven by gearing. The distribution of the electric current to the sparking-plugs is effected by a revolving commutator plate and a stationary brush. Firing of the charge occurs just before the cylinder concerned reaches its highest position, the piston then being at the top of its stroke. Bare brass wires are employed as connections between the sparking-plugs and the commutator. Lubrication is provided for by a reciprocating pump driven in a similar manner to the magneto, and mounted on the same plate. Castor oil only is used, and is injected into the hollow crank-shaft through sight-feed fittings, and from thence to each cylinder.

The engine here exhibited is a nine-cylinder water-cooled engine of the radial type. The cylinders, which are placed symmetrically around the crank-shaft, are of nickel steel machined from solid forgings, the finished thickness of the working barrels being 2 mm. The flat-topped combustion chambers carry bosses into which the casings of the mechanically operated inlet and exhaust valves are screwed. Water jackets of spun copper are brazed to the cylinders and corrugated to permit the working barrels to expand freely. The flat-topped cast-iron pistons are each fitted with three cast-iron spring rings, and are secured by hollow tungsten steel gudgeon-pins to H section steel connecting-rods, all of which operate on one crank-pin by means of a steel cage or connecting rod carrier. The aluminium crank-case is in halves, between which the cylinders are securely clamped and from which the cam-box is detachable. The lubrication is forced, a double pump being fitted below the cam-box; one pump draws oil from the crank-case sump, and delivers it to an external reservoir, where it is cooled, and from where it is drawn by the other pump through a fine wire gauze filtering screen to a sight feed box, whence it is delivered by means of the crank-shaft and cam-box to the big ends, and by exudation to the pistons and gudgeon-pins. Two specially designed Zenith carburetters placed on the horizontal axis of the engine, deliver the explosive mixture through hot-water jacket branches into an annular mixing chamber, and thence by the induction pipes to the several cylinders, in which ignition is effected by a Siemens’ magneto. The engine drives through a reduction gear of 9 to 5, thereby allowing a propeller of larger diameter to be employed.

It is an eight-cylinder V-type water-cooled engine divided into two groups of four cylinders set at 90 degrees. The cast-iron cylinders, which are cast separately, are each attached to the crank-case by eight short studs and four long through bolts, the latter being secured at the top to a bridge or yoke fitting over the cylinder heads. The cast-iron valves having electro-welded steel stems are located in the cylinder heads, and are operated by push rods and rocker arms from a single hollow cam-shaft in the crank-case between the cylinders, the push rods operating the exhaust valves being within tubular push rods operating the inlet valves. The valves, guides, and seats are cast integral with the cylinders, and the combustion chamber is nearly hemispherical. The water jackets are made of ""monel,"" a non-corrosive combination of nickel and copper, and are oxyacetylene welded to the cylinder walls, the whole of the cylinder and jacket being nickel plated. The cooling water is circulated by means of a centrifugal pump, mounted on an extension of the crank-shaft projecting through the crank-case. Lubrication is effected by means of a force pump driven by bevel gearing from a wheel formed integral with the crank-shaft. The pump forces oil through the crank-shaft to the five main bearings, and through the cam-shaft to the latter's bearings, while oil slingers are fitted at each end of the crank-shaft. The lower half of the crank-case is divided into four compartments, which serve as an oil reservoir having a capacity of six hours' flight.

71,,1919-277,Whole,N/A,POLAR INDUCTOR MAGNETO,loaned,POLAR INDUCTOR MAGNETO,"This is a sectioned example of the A.V. 8 S. type of polar inductor magneto. It is suitable for an eight-cylinder aircraft engine. Examples of the materials used in construction are shown adjacent. This type of magneto has a stationary armature and a rotor consisting of four iron masses mounted upon a ""straight-through"" shaft of non-magnetic steel. The current which produces the spark is generated in the stationary armature, and reaches its maximum four times during each revolution of the rotor or polar inductor; accordingly four sparks are produced per revolution. The masses of iron which form the polar inductor are alternately North and South poles, so that in sweeping past the ends or poles of the laminated circuit, they cause, on each occasion, a reversion in the flux. The beginning of the primary winding is connected to the armature core and the end to the secondary winding and to the contact breaker. A cam operates the rocker arm, separating the contacts four times per revolution of the shaft. When the contacts are closed the primary winding is short-circuited, and, as the inductor rotates, the current induced in the primary winding builds up until the cam separates the contacts at the instant when this current is at a maximum.

The current which produces the spark is generated in the stationary armature, and reaches its maximum four times during each revolution of the rotor or polar inductor; accordingly four sparks are produced per revolution.

The lubricator delivers oil under pressure to fourteen different points, the delivery to each being capable of independent regulation. The lubricator consists of an oil container, on the bottom of which are formed two circular discs, each having in its surface 14 holes arranged in a circle, alternate holes leading to the oil container and to one of the delivery pipes. Rotating over the discs, and kept in close contact with them by coiled springs, are two other discs driven by a worm lying between them and engaging with teeth cut in their peripheries. Each disc carries a vertical single-acting pump, the plunger of which is depressed by a series of cams fixed to the top of the container and returned by a helical spring surrounding the plunger. As the disc revolves and the pump comes over a hole connected with the reservoir, the plunger rises under the action of the spring, and oil is sucked into the barrel. As the pump is carried further, it comes over a delivery port and the plunger, which has a roller at its upper end, is forced down by a cam and the charge of oil is expelled. This action takes place seven times per revolution of each disc. The distance through which the plunger rises on the suction stroke can be adjusted by screws attached to the highest flat portions of the cam race, so that the amount of oil drawn in can be regulated.

The original instruments remain in position in the machine. 1. Pitot Tube.—The pitot tube or pressure head is fitted to the outer interplane strut of the machine and is connected to the instrument by means of rubber or aluminium tubing. The open end is connected to the pressure side of the diaphragm, whilst the closed end is connected to the opposite side of the diaphragm, its purpose being to keep the air at atmospheric pressure on this side of the diaphragm. 2. Density Meter.—This instrument is used to correct the ordinary air-speed indicator for the variation in altitude and temperature. The ordinary air-speed indicator under-registers on height, due to the diminished density of the atmosphere, and the density meter is calibrated in numbers, which, when multiplied by the M.P.H. shown on the ordinary air-speed indicator dial, gives the combined correction for variation of both altitude and temperature. 3. Pressure Gauge.—These pressure gauges are of the usual Bourdon tube type, and are made for any ranges from 5–160 lb. All gauges are fitted for over-load, to stand any extra pressure above which they are designed to register. 4. Radiator Thermometer.—This instrument indicates the temperature of the water in the engine cooling system, and depends for its action on the expansion of the ether in the bulb and tubing of the instrument. The expansion causes a pressure which is registered on the dial in degrees of temperature. The boiling point of water drops as the altitude increases, therefore a correction is necessary and can be made by referring to the boiling-point altimeter. 5. Longitudinal Clinometer.—This instrument is fitted with a tube containing greenish-yellow liquid, making it easy to read in semi-darkness. A certain quantity of the liquid is sealed in the tube and rises half-way up it, indicating zero degrees when the machine is flying level ; when the machine is climbing the liquid rises in the tube, and vice versâ when the machine descends. 6. Revolution Indicator.—This instrument is worked on the centrifugal principle, and indicates the engine revolutions in hundreds per minute. The connection to the engine is by means of a flexible drive, which is arranged by means of a gear box on the engine to run at quarter engine speed, the instrument itself being geared 4–1, enabling it to record the actual revolutions of the crank-shaft. 7. Scout Compass, Type 5/17.—This is the standard scout compass, and was used extensively during the war (1914–18). There is no float in this type of instrument, and the card is attached by a wire framework, carrying the magnetic system, to the pivot. The bearing is therefore extremely light, and the liquid has the maximum steadying effect on quick turns of the machine. 8. Air-Speed Indicator.—This instrument depends for its action on the movement of a specially treated silk diaphragm, which is unaffected by moisture or atmospheric conditions. The characteristic of this air-speed indicator lies in the fact that the diaphragm is not called upon to do any work, except that of a diaphragm ; that is to say, it is a mover only, the resistance to the movement being supplied by a highly tempered steel spring. 9. Altitude Recorder. - due to special construction, is practically without “lag.” It is fitted with a button to enable the instrument to be reset to zero to allow for variation in height of aerodromes above mean sea-level. The instrument is also engraved with a temperature scale showing the boiling point of water at various altitudes, enabling the pilot to correct his radiator thermometer when flying at various heights. 10. Wristlet Altimeter. - This instrument is practically the same as the standard model, and is used by the observer for bomb-dropping, &c. 11. “Time of Trip” Clock. - The principal advantage of this clock is the fact that it is fitted with a small subsidiary dial. The latter is quite independent of the ordinary dial showing the time of day, and can be stopped, started, and reset to zero, and records the actual number of hours’ flight made on any particular trip. 12. Lateral Clinometer. - This clinometer is the standard Air Ministry pattern, but with an improvement in the shape of a peculiar-coloured liquid, which shade has been found particularly easy to read between periods of twilight or semi-darkness. It is primarily designed for indicating lateral stability, and also to indicate when a correct “bank” is being made. 13.

This was the first type of aerial camera used by the Royal Flying Corps early in 1915, and was designed by officers of the corps. Previously, ordinary press cameras had been employed. This camera consists of a brass-bound metal conical box with a recessed wooden front to which the lens is fixed, the extension of the camera body acting as a mechanical protection and as a shade for the lens, while at the back is the shutter frame into which the envelope holder for the Mackenzie-Wishart envelopes are fitted. The shutter is of the focal plane type, with adjustable slit, the distance being maintained by the usual cord and clip. An important feature of this shutter lies in the arrangement adopted to prevent the shutter being withdrawn until the blind is wound up. To effect this the shutter winding wheel is normally not in mesh. On pushing in the shutter of the envelope holder a peg jumps out of a cavity in the framework, and enters a depression in the shutter, which cannot now be withdrawn until the blind is fully wound. To effect this the winding wheel is pushed home and then engages the gear, the winding wheel is turned, and when the blind is fully wound up the peg holding the shutter of the plate holder falls out of the depression and the shutter can be withdrawn. The release of the shutter is made by means of a two-way thumb and finger lever conveniently placed at the right-hand side, the camera being held by means of adjustable straps or by brass handles.

The first balloon of this type was built in 1898 by Graf von Zeppelin, and underwent trials in 1900 at Friedrichshafen, on Lake Constance. Subsequent modifications have been in the direction chiefly of greater size and increased motive power. The first flight of a Zeppelin military airship took place in March, 1909. In the first balloon the outer framework of aluminium, which was strongly braced, was covered with linen and silk and enclosed an inner shell, the annular space between them being filled with air. This air acted as an insulator and prevented excessive changes of temperature in the gas contained in the inner shell. The latter was divided into 17 gas-tight compartments, each of which contained a balloon. The motive power was obtained by two motors developing 16 h.p. at 700 revolutions per minute.

The harness fitted is of the “Guardian Angel ” (Calthrop) type. The supporting surface of this parachute is made of fine quality black silk, formed in the section of a sphere. This section has a diameter, when measured on the ground, of 28 ft., but it is contracted to 21 ft. when carrying a load in the air. There is a vent hole at the apex, having a diameter of about eight inches. Compressed air escapes through this hole in a vertical stream, and acts as a universal rudder. Beneath the parachute the air is compressed in the form of an inverted cone, the pressure increasing upwards to the parachute body. The maximum air pressure is within the body and as it escapes over the edge of the periphery. The rigging consists of 48 lines, which run from the fabric a distance of about 5 ft. From this point 24 lines are employed; they run direct to a wooden ring, 14 in. diameter. The harness is connected to this ring by a length of rope and is easily removable. The “Guardian Angel” harness, patented in 1914 by Mr. E. R. Calthrop, consists of two oval aluminium arm-pieces connected to a web belt. The parachute is attached directly to these arm-pieces and to the belt. The parachutist’s body is supported by the arm-pieces, the belt, and by a strap which passes between the legs. A quick re’ease mechanism is fitted to guard against the danger of being dragged along the ground after alighting. When the lever is moved to the vertical the three parts of the fastening are unlocked and the harness may be instantly removed. In the locked position the lever is kept stationary by means of the leather slide. When the parachute is withdrawn from the case it opens in two to three seconds, the momentum is absorbed, and the parachutist adopts the average rate of fall, which is, approximately, 16 ft. per second, or 10.9 miles per hour.

The instrument is intended for the reception of both spark and continuous wave signals and may be used in aircraft either for wireless telegraphy or telephony. For the principle on which this instrument is based see wireless apparatus, collection of electrical engineering. The receiver is a combined tuner, detector and amplifier. It is capable of receiving spark signals on the wave length ranges of 150–350 metres and 500–700 metres. In addition it can receive both spark and continuous wave signals on the range of 1,000–2,500 metres. Three hard vacuum valves of the French pattern are employed. The first acts as a detector and high-frequency amplifier, while the second and third amplify audio-frequencies only. A filament rheostat is situated in the middle of the terminal panel. It consists of a helix of manganin wire of 1·2 ohms resistance. A detector valve grid condenser of 1·6 jars capacity, with mica dielectric, is connected to the grid of the first valve and is shunted by a carbon rod resistance. The carbon rod resistance is of the Remco type and of approximately 2 megohms. The multiple-segment wave length switch has three positions, one for each of the three ranges of wave-length. It makes all the necessary connections in each case, with the exception of the parallel condenser which has a separate adjust-ment. The timing variometer has inside and outside coils wound with 7/36 S.W.G. copper wire. The inductance of each coil when alone is approximately 290 microhms; when connected in series as a variometer the range is from 140 to 1,060 microhms. The variometer is graduated in degrees only, calibration cards being supplied for the various aerial capacities. The terminals of the instrument are arranged so that it may be used conveniently on a closed aerial coil for direction finding. The parallel condensers are four in number. They have copper foil conductors and mica dielectric clamped together between ebonite plates. Their capacities are marked above the switch. Two telephone jacks are fitted, one being in the anode circuit of the first valve and the other in the anode circuit of the third valve. The batteries required are one of 6 volts and one of 100 volts. They are connected to the plug sockets which are marked appropriately.",,,"[{'name': 'The Air Ministry', 'role': 'lender'}]",,,manganin; mica; carbon; copper; ebonite,"150–350 metres; 500–700 metres; 1,000–2,500 metres; 1·2 ohms; 1·6 jars; 2 megohms; 7/36 S.W.G.; 290 microhms; 140 to 1,060 microhms; 6 volts; 100 volts","This receiver was designed for use by H.M. aerial forces during the war (1914–1918).
