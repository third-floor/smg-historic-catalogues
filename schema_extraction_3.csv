The furnace consists of a simple cavity in the ground, lined with a mixture of clay and powdered charcoal. A blowpipe, supplied with air by some sort of bellows, provides a blast for the combustion of the charcoal used for smelting. In using the furnace the previously dried cavity is filled with charcoal, which is piled above it to a height of about 3 in. When the charcoal is alight, and a gentle blast has been started, a layer of ore, previously calcined if rich in sulphur, is spread over its surface, with any flux of quartz or limestone that may be necessary, then another layer of charcoal, and then alternate layers of charge and charcoal until a conical heap has been formed. The blast is increased, and the whole charge gradually sinks down as the charcoal is consumed and the ore is reduced to metal. The blast is then stopped, the slag and unconsumed charcoal removed, and the metal allowed to solidify. The solidified metal is then removed and put aside for subsequent treatment, or is left in the furnace and another charge worked upon it.

Made from drawings prepared in the Museum. This model represents a primitive type of hearth for the production of malleable iron, in which the fire is urged by bellows. Districts where this method reached a high development and survived long enough to be technically described were Catalonia, in Spain (hence the name given to the process), and the Pyrenees, where documentary evidence carries the practice back as far as 1293. The furnace represented was in use at Montgaillard, Department of Ariège, in 1834. The building used as the forge was situated where water power was available. The furnace was close beside the main wall of the building and consisted of a rectangular hearth, at the floor level lined with refractory stone, and clay, except at the working side, which was of wrought iron to resist wear. Through the wall projected, at an inclination of about 40 deg., the tuyère, which was made of a piece of copper sheet bent into a conical tube. The end was joined by leather to a goose-neck on a wind chest, supplied with blast by an induced current apparatus known as a “trompe.” This apparatus, which is believed to have been invented in Italy about 1640, consisted of a wooden cistern over two vertical trees or hooped wooden pipes. The top of each is contracted by two flat pieces of wood so that the water falls in a thin stream. Opposite this jet are holes in the trees to admit the induced air. The amount of water flowing in is determined by a lever-controlled wedge in the throat of each pipe. The water is separated from the blast by a baffle and escapes over a water-sealed weir. The pressure obtained was from 1.5 to 2 lb. per sq. in. The blast was remarkably steady, but the entrained water introduced into the furnace was a drawback. The furnace, still red hot, was charged to the tuyère level with fresh charcoal; brown hematite, averaging 45 per cent. metallic iron, was charged, covered to the top with charcoal breeze, and the blast turned on. Fresh charcoal and ore were thrown on and the blast adjusted from time to time. The smelter collected the various pieces of the iron and pushed them towards the centre of the hearth, where he agglomerated them. When it was seen that the iron had begun to burn, the blast was stopped and the bloom withdrawn by the aid of a bar and tongs and subjected to treatment under a helve hammer. The duration of a heat was about 6 hrs. A smelter and one assistant were required. The usual product was 100 kg. of merchant iron from 312 kg. of ore with a consumption of 340 kg. of charcoal.",,,"[{'name': 'unknown', 'role': 'inventor'}]","['Catalonia, in Spain', 'Pyrenees', 'Montgaillard, Department of Ariège', 'Italy']","['1293', '1834', '1640']","['malleable iron', 'refractory stone', 'clay', 'wrought iron', 'copper sheet', 'leather', 'wood', 'charcoal', 'brown hematite', 'charcoal breeze']","['Scale 1 : 20', 'about 40 deg.', '1.5 to 2 lb. per sq. in.', '6 hrs.', '100 kg.', '312 kg.', '340 kg.']","['This model represents a primitive type of hearth for the production of malleable iron, in which the fire is urged by bellows.', 'Districts where this method reached a high development and survived long enough to be technically described were Catalonia, in Spain (hence the name given to the process), and the Pyrenees, where documentary evidence carries the practice back as far as 1293.', 'The building used as the forge was situated where water power was available.', 'The blast was remarkably steady, but the entrained water introduced into the furnace was a drawback.', 'The smelter collected the various pieces of the iron and pushed them towards the centre of the hearth, where he agglomerated them.', 'When it was seen that the iron had begun to burn, the blast was stopped and the bloom withdrawn by the aid of a bar and tongs and subjected to treatment under a helve hammer.', 'The usual product was 100 kg. of merchant iron from 312 kg. of ore with a consumption of 340 kg. of charcoal.']","[""Richard—Études sur l'art d'extraire le Fer, 1838""]",1838,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 1, 'terms': ['goose-neck']}"

11,2318,Inv. 1924-790,Whole,N/A,,loaned,MODEL OF MECHANICAL CHARGING APPARATUS FOR IRON BLAST FURNACES,"This model represents a charging apparatus suitable for furnaces with large outputs. A uniform distribution of the charge and reduction of labour are secured by the use of a mechanical charger of this type. The apparatus consists of an inclined girder tramway on which are two lines of rails, so that the weight of the ascending skip is balanced by that of the descending skip on the other line. These skips carry about 2 tons of ore, and are made of strong sheet-iron. They run on four flanged wheels, of which the two in front are half the thickness of those at the rear. A special guide rail is provided at the top of the furnace, placed so that the narrower front wheels, when descending, pass by it, while the broader hind wheels mount upon the guide, with the result that the back of the skip is lifted up and the charge in the skip is shot into the upper hopper, provided with a small cup and cone. When sufficient material has accumulated in this hopper, the weight of the charge causes the cone to fall, allowing the charge to fall into a gas chamber, which in its turn is also provided with cup and cone discharge of normal dimensions, fitted with a balance weight.

14,SECTIONAL MODELS OF HOT BLAST STOVES,Inv. 1897-138 and 143,Whole,N/A,models,,SECTIONAL MODELS OF HOT BLAST STOVES,"(Scale 1: 24.) Mr. E. A. Cowper 1857 / 1882 These two models show the construction of the apparatus patented by Mr. E. A. Cowper in 1857 and subsequently, for utilising the waste gases from blast furnaces to heat the blast; they are a type of “regenerator,” and by their use the consumption of fuel per ton of pig iron produced is greatly diminished. The stoves are arranged in pairs, one stove absorbing heat from the waste gases, while the other is giving off its previously absorbed heat to the blast, the process being reversed at intervals as the stored heat is abstracted. Each stove consists of a vertical shell of wrought iron, to give the strength necessary to resist the pressure of the blast, lined with firebrick, and containing a large vertical passage or “flame flue” built in firebrick. The waste gases are brought in below the base of this chamber and pass up into it through three ports, there mixing with the requisite amount of air for combustion from an air inlet valve. The mass of flame then passes to the top of the stove and returns downward through a large number of small passages built in firebrick, to which the heat is transmitted, the cooled products passing by an underground flue to a chimney. While this is going on the blast for the furnace is being sent through the other stove in the reverse direction, so that the cold blast first meets the coolest part of the stove and passes on to the hottest. The extreme temperatures of the firebrick do not greatly differ during the cycle, the regenerative action depending rather on the extent to which the high temperature zone extends towards the cooler part of the stove, or upon the change in the average temperature of the total amount of firebrick. The stoves are cleared from dust by firing a small gun into an aperture near the base, but it has since been found that by suddenly releasing the pressure in a stove the passages are very effectually cleaned. In one of the models the regenerator brickwork is formed of rectangular bricks on edge, bonded in a way which leaves passages that, while facilitating the absorption of heat, have ledges upon which dust deposits. The other model shows the modification that was introduced by Mr. Cowper in 1882 to avoid this difficulty; special firebrick blocks, known as “honeycomb filling,” are used, which, when fitted together, leave a large number of hexagonal channels that, while easy to clean, present a great amount of heating surface.

Gjers, Mills & Co. 1870 This represents the general arrangement of these iron works, situated on the River Tees at Middlesbrough, built in 1870, and covering an area of 32 acres. The raw materials, in the shape of ironstone, coke, and limestone, are brought in wagons to an inclined road, down which they descend by gravity to a pneumatic hoist, which lifts them to a height of 35 ft. to the gantry passing over the depot and calcining kilns. The ironstone is tipped into these kilns, of which there is a set of four to each pair of furnaces; the coke into two boxes, situated between the sets of kilns; small coal for the kilns into a depot close to the hoist, and the limestone into two bunkers, one at each end of the sets of kilns. The kilns are of the form patented in 1863 by Mr. J. Gjers. Each consists of a shell lined with firebrick, resting on a cast-iron ring, supported on columns, so as to leave an opening at the bottom of the kiln through which the calcined stone is withdrawn. The kilns are 33 ft. high by 24 ft. diam., and are each capable of calcining 1,000 tons of ironstone per week. After being emptied, the wagons run by gravity to the further end of the gantry, where they are lowered to the level by a hoist and despatched to sidings. The ironstone, coke, and limestone, taken from the depots are filled into iron barrows, which, after being weighed, are elevated to the furnace tops by pneumatic hoists, which are made of cast-iron flanged cylinders, 36 in. diam. The furnaces, which are built of brickwork hooped with iron, are 85 ft. high and 25 ft. diam. at the boshes. They are closed with the cup and cone arrangement, the gases being carried through tubes into a culvert below and thence distributed to the stoves and boilers. They are each blown by five tuyères, and are equal to the production of about 2,500 tons of pig iron per week. For each furnace there is one hot blast stove, consisting of 14 double-legged pipes of flat section. The cold blast from the main enters each stove by means of a breeches pipe connected outside, and the hot blast passes out by a similar pipe at the opposite end of the stove, and is delivered into a horseshoe main, which passes round the furnaces. Each stove has an ordinary firegrate to enable firing to be done in case of stoppage, but this grate is closed up when the stove is at work. Twelve egg-ended boilers provide steam for three vertical direct-acting blowing engines, one of which is, however, always held in reserve. They work at 50 lb. steam pressure, and supply the blast at a pressure of from 4.5 to 5 lb. A series of fountains are used to cool the water from the tuyère coils.

The iron is used for conversion into steel and for ordinary blacksmith’s work. As now built the hearth is rectangular, enclosed by cast-iron plates, with renewable linings. The bottom plate is protected by a layer of slag, and is kept cool by a jacket, into which water is led ; the overflow passes to a drain. Two water-cooled tuyères, one on each side, are supplied with blast at a pressure of 1 to 1.5 lb. per sq. in., warmed to about 180° C. by passing through a U pipe in the waste gas flue. The fore plate, or cast-iron table in front, serves to manipulate the charge. The hearth is filled with fresh charcoal, and the charge, which is in the form of trapezoidal pigs that were in the previous operation pushed through a side door on to a cast-iron plate in the waste gas flue in order to get hot, is now drawn on the top of the charcoal. More charcoal is piled on and the blast is turned on. In about half an hour the metal will have melted and passed through the blast, becoming partially oxidized, till it comes into contact with the basic iron slag on the bottom left from the previous operation. The refining consists in breaking up the metal with a bar and carrying it to the tuyères. The more highly carburised iron, being more fusible, continually drops away till the whole is pasty. The final operation is to bring the lumps of iron to a welding heat with fresh charcoal and make them into a ball. The ball is removed from the furnace, consolidated into a bloom, reheated and rolled into bars. Slag, if present in excess, is tapped out by the holes in front. The whole operation lasts about 70 minutes. In front of the furnace is shown a power-driven rabble, recently introduced to relieve the muscular exertion involved. The overhead shaft, through a clutch and reducing spur gear, drives a connecting rod, which gives partial rotation to a crankshaft, whose bearings are on the furnace front. The bar used for bringing the charge from the bottom of the hearth to the vicinity of the tuyères. has a projection which is caught by the crank as it comes down and forced under the charge. The bar is then manipulated from the fore hearth. Some rabbles have cranks for the latter operation also. The charge consists of about 275 lb. of pig iron; 11.8 cub. ft., equal to about 160 lb., of charcoal is required for refining it.

The model represents a furnace used for this process at Bromford Iron Works, South Staffordshire, in 1860. The casing is formed of ribbed cast-iron plates, held together at the top by tie-bolts and at the bottom by a wrought iron trough. The arched roof, sides, and fireplace are made of Stourbridge firebricks. The bed is lined with refractory substances rich in oxide of iron, such as “bull dog.” The grate area, 14 sq. ft., is almost as large as that of the bed. The furnace is fired from a small hole, kept closed by coal piled upon the ledge projecting below it. A fire bridge divides the grate from the hearth, the bed and sides of which are made of cast-iron plates supported on columns and cooled by air circulating beneath. The door is suspended from a lever and is used for “fettling,” charging the pig iron, and for taking out the finished blooms; for the actual puddling there is a small hole at the bottom of the door. Below this is a tap-hole to let out the accumulated slag or “tap cinder” at the end of the operation; normally it is closed with sand. The waste gases are led by a flue to a chimney stack of brick, bound with angles and tie-bolts, and supported on cast-iron columns.

The furnace shown is of the usual construction, having a cast-iron bed lined with oxide and silicate of iron, and the masonry strengthened by external cast-iron plates. The waste gases from the hearth pass into an enlarged or iron-cased stack, carried on columns and terminating in an ordinary stack or iron-cased chimney. The enlarged portion of the stack is divided by a vertical wall into two flues, one of which is clear and passes the gases upwards, unless it should be closed by the horizontal damper moved by rack and pinion; the other chamber also communicates with the stack, but contains cast-iron pipes standing on a divided box. Into one side of the box air is forced by an external steam-jet blower, and this air, in traversing the pipes, is heated to about 340° C.; it then passes along a pipe at the back of the furnace into the closed ashpit. A portion of this heated blast is introduced through tuyères into the space above the fuel, while some is blown downwards upon the fire from orifices in a bridge pipe of brickwork built in the crown.

The model shows two 3-ton converters (AA), placed on opposite sides of the casting pit, in the centre of which is a hydraulic crane (C), carrying the casting ladle. This crane can be swung round so that the ladle can receive its charge from either converter, and is provided with a bottom tapping hole, by which the contents can be run into ingots in a series of tapered iron moulds arranged circularly. Just outside the pit are two hydraulic cranes (DD) for stripping the moulds and lifting the ingots. Opposite the pit are the valves (B), viz., the air valves for controlling the blowing, and the hydraulic valves for controlling the raising and lowering of the converters and the lifting of the ladle crane. On the platform of the ladle crane itself are the handles for turning the gear, for swinging the ladle round to carry the charge of steel from the converters to the ingot moulds, and also the tipping gear for emptying the residue and slag from the ladle ; there is also a locking gear to hold the ladle upright. A pair of vertical engines work two 3-throw sets of hydraulic pumps (E), and a pair of horizontal high-pressure blowing engines (FF) supply the air, which is blown into the metal at a pressure of from 15 to 25 lb. per sq. in., through the tuyères in the bottom of the converters (see No. 37).",,,"[{'name': 'T.

After blowing, the steel is poured into a ladle carried by a circular crane, from which it is teemed into the casting ladle; carried by the central crane of the casting pit. The steel is then run into the ingot moulds in the usual manner, and as soon as sufficiently set the moulds are stripped off by one of the small hydraulic cranes and the hot ingots transferred by a similar crane to a soaking pit.

A freshly cast ingot is much hotter in the interior than at the surface, and this unequal distribution of temperature prevented its being worked until it had cooled and been re-heated; but by placing the ingot for some time in a closed firebrick chamber the heat becomes uniformly distributed, so that the ingot, when withdrawn from this soaking pit, is in a fit state for rolling down into billets in the cogging mill shown.

The steel is made from a charge of pig iron, oxide of iron, steel scrap, and lime, which is melted on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace whose bed is covered with a basic lining formed of dolomite or magnesite. The oxygen in the charge consumes the excess carbon in the cast iron, while the phosphorus is removed by the flux formed from the basic lining; an addition of ferro-manganese is, however, made after tapping to ensure the improved qualities that the presence of manganese promotes.
The open hearth of the furnace consists of a shallow rectangular pan of cast-iron plates supported on girders, which permit of the free circulation of air below it to keep it cool, and protected above by a covering of firebrick and the thick lining of basic material which forms the bed of the hearth; the roof over the hearth is formed by a silica brick arch, and the side walls are also of silica brick, but are externally protected by a wrought-iron casing, strengthened by vertical rods or buckstaves, held together by long transverse tie-rods.
The furnace is entirely heated by the combustion of producer gas, which, together with the necessary air, is introduced through ports at one end of the hearth, after passing over which the gases escape by similar ports and down through the large regenerator chambers beneath the furnace, and thence to a flue leading to a stack. The producer gas is supplied through a gas flue, from which it passes under a mushroom valve, regulated by a hand wheel on the charging platform, and past a butterfly reversing valve to a flue communicating with the bottom of the outer and smaller of the pair of regenerator chambers at the end of the furnace. It then ascends through the interstices between the open brick-work with which the chamber is packed, and thence through a vertical flue and central port at the end of the hearth. The air for the combustion of this gas enters another flue by a similar mushroom valve, worked from the charging platform, and, passing a butterfly reversing valve, reaches a flue leading to the bottom of the inner and larger of this pair of regenerators, through the brickwork packing of which it passes to the two upper ports at this end of the hearth. The combustible mixture thus arriving at this end of the hearth burns forming a continuous sheet of flame, which passes along the hearth and through the three corresponding ports at the opposite end and down through the open brickwork into a similar pair of regenerators beneath that end of the furnace, and then through the horizontal flues to the butterfly reversing valves, by which the considerably cooled gases are passed to a flue, fitted with a sliding damper, controlled from the platform, and communicating with the stack, which gives the draught and also carries away the products of combustion.
When the furnace has been working in this way for about half an hour, the direction of the gases is reversed, so that the producer gas and the air for its combustion are passed through the heated brickwork of the other pair of regenerators, and are thus raised to a high temperature before entering into combustion over the hearth, the rejected heat at the other end of the hearth being similarly absorbed by the other pair of regenerators. This reversal of the course of the gases is effected by the two butterfly valves arranged beneath the gas and air valves and controlled by levers from the charging platform.
After the heating has been maintained for about 10 hrs. and the charge is ready for tapping, the tap-hole is pierced, so that the metal flows into a hinged shoot, which conveys it into a casting ladle, mounted on a carriage running on rails on the sides of the casting pit in which the ingot moulds are arranged. The ferro-manganese and any nickel that may be required are added in a heated, but solid, condition to the metal while it is flowing into this casting ladle. The metal is delivered into the moulds through a hole in the bottom of the ladle, fitted with a plug, which can be lifted by an external lever. When the whole of the metal has been ""teemed"" the ladle is turned over by means of worm gear and the slag poured into a cast-iron slag pot, while the slag remaining in the hearth of the furnace is run off by the hinged shoot into another slag pot.",,,"[{'name': 'Robert Booth', 'role': 'information furnished by'}, {'name': 'Bernard Dawson', 'role': 'designed'}]","['Round Oak, Staffordshire']",,"['steel', 'pig iron', 'oxide of iron', 'steel scrap', 'lime', 'dolomite', 'magnesite', 'ferro-manganese', 'cast-iron', 'firebrick', 'silica brick', 'wrought-iron', 'producer gas', 'nickel']","['Scale 1 : 24.', '25-ton']","['This represents a 25-ton open-hearth regenerative steel-melting furnace, forming one of a series designed by Mr. Bernard Dawson and erected at the Earl of Dudley’s Steel Works at Round Oak, Staffordshire.', 'The steel is made from a charge of pig iron, oxide of iron, steel scrap, and lime, which is melted on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace whose bed is covered with a basic lining formed of dolomite or magnesite.', 'The oxygen in the charge consumes the excess carbon in the cast iron, while the phosphorus is removed by the flux formed from the basic lining;

The charge of pig iron and scrap is loaded in special charging boxes, three at a time, on bogies, which are pushed along rails on the charging platform immediately in front of the furnaces. The machine consists of a built-up steel carriage capable of travelling on rails parallel with those for the bogies. The carriage supports overhead rails at right angles to these, and along them moves a truck whence is suspended on trunnions a charging arm, which is capable of motion through a vertical arc by cranks and connecting rods at the rear, where the operator’s platform is situated. To prevent running back, this motion is fitted with a magnetic brake of the multiple disc type. The end of the arm is squared to enter a slot in the end of the charging box, where it is locked by a rod passing up the centre of the arm. The arm is tilted and the whole machine travels along till it is opposite the door of the furnace to be charged (as shown). The arm is then traversed by the truck until the box is over the desired part of the bed. The forward part of the arm is turned by spur gearing till the box is emptied, and the latter is withdrawn and replaced on the bogie. The cycle of operations takes ½ to 1 min. Separate series-wound electric motors, with reduction spur gearing, are provided for (i) travelling the machine, (ii) traversing, (iii) tilting it, (iv) turning the arm; these, with the locking rod lever, are under the control of one man.

The differences between this process and the ordinary one are: the use of fluid pig iron to save time and to avoid lowering the temperature; the oxidation of the metalloids entirely by oxide of iron instead of by the latter and air conjointly, thereby increasing the yield by about 5 per cent.; the maintenance of a large reserve of heat by tapping out a portion only of the charge at one time. A basic lining and a tilting hearth of the Wellman type are found to be most suitable for the process.

The cementation process, for converting wrought iron into steel, consists in maintaining wrought iron for several days at a red heat while embedded in charcoal and protected from the air, whereby the iron gradually absorbs carbon, which combines with it and converts it into steel. The method is a development of the case-hardening process, and is very old, but Réaumur, in a work published in 1722, appears to have been the first to examine it experimentally; he also describes the furnaces then in use, which were very similar to those employed at Sheffield and elsewhere. The wrought iron to be treated, usually in the form of 3 in. by 0.75 in. high-quality flat bars, is packed in open rectangular chests or “pots,” built of sandstone or firebrick, which are placed on either side of a long coal-fired grate, the products of combustion being carried through a series of flues along the bottom, sides, and ends of the chest. These flues open into an enclosing arched firebrick chamber, provided with doorways at the ends, and three short chimneys or eyes on each side just at the springing of the arch, so as to create a distributed draught. The whole is sheltered under a hollow cone of brickwork, about 50 ft. high, which retains much of the heat, and delivers the waste gases at a sufficient elevation, while preventing the formation of a strong draught. These cementation plants are usually built in groups, as shown, with each chest measuring from 10 to 15 ft. in length by 2.5 to 3 ft. square, and holding 8 to 12 tons of wrought iron. The bars are packed between layers of wood charcoal, and when the chest is full the top is plastered over with clay or “wheel-swarf,” a mixture of silica and oxide of iron from the grinderies, which, when heated frits and forms an airtight lid. The entrances of the chamber are walled up and the fire lighted, so that in two or three days the chests are at a glowing red heat, i.e., a temperature of 1,170° C., which is maintained for five or six days. The fire is then drawn and the furnace allowed to cool during two or three more days, in which time, however, the process is still proceeding and completing itself. At intervals during the process, bars left protruding from the side openings, in order to judge, from their fracture, of the extent of the conversion, which is varied according to the purpose for which the steel is to be used. The coal consumed is about equal in weight to that of the steel produced, and the capacity of each furnace is about 26 tons per week. The surfaces of the bars after treatment are covered with blisters of various sizes, so that this material is known as “blister steel.” In this form it is very rarely used, but is subsequently forged into some of the various grades of shear steel, or else melted in crucibles.",,,"[{'name': 'Messrs.

The wrought iron to be treated, usually in the form of 3 in. by 0.75 in. high-quality flat bars, is packed in open rectangular chests or “pots,” built of sandstone or firebrick, which are placed on either side of a long coal-fired grate, the products of combustion being carried through a series of flues along the bottom, sides, and ends of the chest. These flues open into an enclosing arched firebrick chamber, provided with doorways at the ends, and three short chimneys or eyes on each side just at the springing of the arch, so as to create a distributed draught. The whole is sheltered under a hollow cone of brickwork, about 50 ft. high, which retains much of the heat, and delivers the waste gases at a sufficient elevation, while preventing the formation of a strong draught. These cementation plants are usually built in groups, as shown, with each chest measuring from 10 to 15 ft. in length by 2.5 to 3 ft. square, and holding 8 to 12 tons of wrought iron. The bars are packed between layers of wood charcoal, and when the chest is full the top is plastered over with clay or “wheel-swarf,” a mixture of silica and oxide of iron from the grinderies, which, when heated frits and forms an airtight lid. The entrances of the chamber are walled up and the fire lighted, so that in two or three days the chests are at a glowing red heat, i.e., a temperature of 1,170° C., which is maintained for five or six days. The fire is then drawn and the furnace allowed to cool during two or three more days, in which time, however, the process is still proceeding and completing itself. At intervals during the process, bars left protruding from the side openings, in order to judge, from their fracture, of the extent of the conversion, which is varied according to the purpose for which the steel is to be used. The coal consumed is about equal in weight to that of the steel produced, and the capacity of each furnace is about 26 tons per week. The surfaces of the bars after treatment are covered with blisters of various sizes, so that this material is known as “blister steel.” In this form it is very rarely used, but is subsequently forged into some of the various grades of shear steel, or else melted in crucibles.",Réaumur,1722,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 1, 'terms': ['grinderies']}"

The form of tilt hammer represented has a steel-faced head, weighing from 120 to 500 lb., wedged on to a wooden shaft, which is hooped with iron and provided with a cast-iron trunnion hoop by which it is supported on brasses, adjustable in vertical standards by folding wedges.

52,,"1857-222, 31095",Whole,N/A,,donated,MODEL OF ROLLING MILLS WITH HEATING FURNACES,"(Scale 1:8.) Presented by Messrs. Naylor, Vickers & Co. Squeezing between rolls is the most rapid method of reducing a slab of iron or steel to the form of plate or sheet metal, and nearly all other materials possessing the necessary qualifications for standing the treatment are also reduced in this way. In 1784 Henry Cort, by the introduction of grooved and collared rolls, vastly increased the value of the rolling mill, as he thus enabled it to prepare round and flat bars, together with the other numerous sections since employed as rails and girders. In bringing a mass of metal from a large to a smaller section, working under a hammer appears to be most beneficial, but the greater rapidity and economy of the rolling process renders its use almost universal, except for the preliminary forging of the highest qualities of cast steel. The rolls used in the preliminary forging of heavy masses of iron and steel have rolls of from 4 ft. diam. downwards; but the mill here represented is of a lighter type, as it is only intended for treating crucible cast-steel ingots.
The engine (not shown) is placed between the sheet mill and the bar mill, and the lower line of rolls in each mill is directly driven, while the top roll is driven from it by pinions arranged in stands or housings at each side of the engine. The distance between the rolls is adjusted by screws through the top ends or housings, which limit the amount to which the top roll may rise when the bar or plate is passing beneath it; to allow for this vertical play, the ends of the rolls are made square and are connected by a short square shaft, which is coupled to the adjacent ends by loosely-fitting cast-iron muffs or boxes, which, while giving the requisite freedom, also protect the rolls in case of accident, since these inexpensive boxes will break before a roll is injured.
The sheet mill has a single stand of rolls, 16 in. diam., while the bar mill has four stands of rolls of 9 in. diam., for preparing round, square, and flat sections; in front of these rolls is a table for supporting the end of a bar before passing it into the rolls, and for some of the sections a directing guide is clamped to the table for ensuring the entry of the rod into the intended groove. With only two rolls in a housing, it is usual, after a bar has passed over the top and then pass it in the original direction through the next set of grooves or rolls. In dealing with large sections it is more usual to reverse the engine so that the bar or plate is given its next passage while entering from the opposite side; the same result is also obtained by having three rolls, the first pass being through the lower pair and the return through the upper pair, without reversing the engine.
Near these rolls is shown a shearing machine, also driven from the engine, used for cutting bars into lengths for piling and for cropping the finished rods.
As the steel can only be successfully and economically rolled at a red heat, it is necessary to have furnaces near the mill for heating the material, or for re-heating it should it cool too much during the rolling process; these furnaces are here arranged in pairs with a common stack, one pair being for heating piles of bars, while the other is for sheets.

Made from drawings prepared in the Museum. This shows the modification made in the furnaces used for melting steel in crucibles by the application, for the purpose of reducing the fuel consumption, of the Siemens regenerative principle, which appears to have first been adapted to this work in 1862. Several positions for the regenerators have been tried, e.g., they have been built at the ends of the melting chamber, and at right angles to one side, but the most usual arrangement is as here shown, with the regenerators alongside and below the general level. The hearth, or melting chamber, is divided by cross walls into from two to ten holes, each accommodating six crucibles. Each melting hole, or laboratory, is so short, except in the arrangement where the regenerators are at the two ends, that it is necessary to mix the air and gas intimately before they enter this region; contrary to the usual practice with open-hearth furnaces, nearest the melting chamber, and the stream of gas for this purpose the gas regenerator is placed, brought up through three small ports into the corresponding horizontal streams of air; in addition, the ports on opposite sides are out of line, so as to ensure cross currents. The resulting flame is bent downward by a deflecting arch, so as to be concentrated upon the crucibles, which stand on a bed of coke-dust supported on ribbed cast-iron plates, resting on side walls and cooled by an air space left below; these bottom plates have holes in them which are closed by old lids, etc., but allow access to each melting hole for cleaning out the clinker at the end of a week's run, or should a crucible break. The top of each melting hole is closed by a cover, made in three pieces, which are handled by a lever supported on the axle of a two-wheeled bogie, or by a chain from wheels on an overhead rail. The crucibles are lifted, after the gas and air have been shut off, by the ""puller out,"" who uses tongs which partially embrace them, and the metal is poured by a ""teemer,"" who uses a pair of tongs which holds the crucible at right angles to those for lifting; the other pair of tongs is for removing the cover of the crucible. The gas from the producers is brought to the regenerators, and so to the furnace, through a culvert, and the waste gases from the regenerators pass in a similar way to a chimney (not shown). The admission of gas and air is regulated by mushroom valves, adjustable by hand wheels at the floor level, and the currents of air and gas are reversed at intervals by ordinary flap valves moved by levers. The consumption of fuel over extended periods has been found to be about 1 lb. of slack coal to the pound of ingot poured, and, owing to the ready control of the temperature, the labour of handling the crucibles is reduced, so that the charges melted are from 60 to 80 lb., and even heavier where plumbago crucibles are used.

The fuel used is charcoal and the blast is obtained by means of bellows made from a goat skin. The lumps of iron are hammered out into a solid mass, which is then extended into bar form by re-heating and hammering. Steel is also produced in some districts by direct smelting from iron ores.

60,,1925-120,Whole,N/A,SECTIONAL MODEL,,SECTIONAL MODEL OF HÉROULT ELECTRIC FURNACE,"Made from information supplied by Messrs. Campbell & Gifford, Ltd. This is a typical example of the class of electric furnaces in which the heat is produced mainly by an arc, and to a much smaller extent by the resistance offered by the whole or a portion of the charge to a powerful electric current. The furnace is used for melting and refining Bessemer or open-hearth scrap, and for the manufacture of alloy steels. The furnace is essentially an open-hearth tilting furnace, resembling in many ways the Wellman furnace. It is lined with basic material. Two or three electrodes pass through the roof, water-cooling chambers being placed at the piercing points, in order to keep the external portions of the electrodes and the brickwork of the roof at permissible temperatures. The electrodes may be raised or lowered by electric motor-driven mechanism, controlled by hand or automatically. In the latter case, variations in the voltage or current in the furnace, within defined limits, actuate the mechanism which controls the motor. At the ends of the furnace, where the gas ports are found in an ordinary Wellman furnace, are charging doors, and there is a movable door over the pouring spout. In starting the furnace for melting and refining, some lime and iron ore are placed upon the furnace bottom, followed by wrought-iron and steel scrap. The electrodes are lowered to establish an electric circuit (the charge being in actual contact with them), the iron melting numerous small arcs and high-resistance contacts are formed, causing violent fluctuations of current until all the metal is molten. The electrodes are then raised just clear of the bath, so that the air-gaps are bridged by arcs. The current thus passes from one electrode through the air-gap to the slag, through the slag to the metal, and back through the same layer of slag to the other electrode. If the electrodes are lowered to or just below the surface of the slag, the furnace becomes a pure resistance furnace. When the bath is completely molten, and violent fluctuations of current have ceased, a 3-ton furnace will require an alternating current of about 4,000 amps. at 110 volts for normal working.

101,,17520,Whole,N/A,SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING THE MANUFACTURE OF GOLD-LEAF,donated,SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATING THE MANUFACTURE OF GOLD-LEAF,"The art of gold-beating is an extremely ancient one, having been in existence at least 4,000 years ago, since gold has been found with Egyptian remains. With the progression of time, the art of beating thinner gold has been discovered, and yet thinner gold leaf is produced, but the process as used to-day differs but little from that employed by the ancient Egyptians. The process requires very little machinery, and that only in the initial stages, the greater part of this process requiring only the skilful use of a hand hammer. The process consists essentially of the following stages:— The fine gold is alloyed with a proportion of copper and silver, to give the desired colour and quality of leaf. This alloy is melted and cast into a bar, which is gradually reduced by rolling, with frequent annealing, to a “ribbon,” 1⅛ in. wide, and 2 yards in length to the ounce. This ribbon is then cut into square pieces, each piece weighing 6 grains, and placed between the leaves of a “cutch” (consisting of 200 sheets of parchment prepared from animal matter), measuring 4 in. square. The “cutch” is bound with parchment bands and beaten for about 30 min. with a 20-lb. hammer, until each square of gold ribbon has become as large as the “cutch.” The leaves of gold are now removed from the sheets of parchment paper, quartered with a “skewing” knife, and the quarters placed between the skins of a “shoder” (containing 800 rather coarse strong skins of 4½ in. square). The “shoder” requires 2 hrs. careful beating; for this purpose a 12-lb. hammer is used, and the beating is continued until the quarter leaves have spread to the edges of the skins. They are again cut into quarters, this time with a sharpened reed, and the quarters placed between the skins of a “mould” (composed of 1,000 very thin sheets of gold-beaters’ skin, 5⅛ in. square; these 1,000 skins measure less than 1 in. in thickness and weigh but a few ounces). The “mould” requires some 5 hrs. beating with an 8-lb. hammer. It is in this final beating that the quality of the finished leaf is determined, and the greatest skill on the part of the beater is required. The beating is done on solid blocks of marble, some of which are centuries old, handed down from generation to generation of gold-beaters. Here and there there are the deep holes formed in the marble by the mere pressure of the thumb of the worker as he holds down the mould. When the leaves are beaten to the required size and thinness, they are removed from the skins, placed singly on a calf-skin cushion and trimmed to size with sharpened reeds fixed in a small frame called a “waggon,” and afterwards placed between the sheets of thin paper books. From the “ribbon” stage until the finished leaves are in books the gold is never touched by the hand, but manipulated with boxwood pincers. To illustrate the malleability of gold, it may be stated that 12 dwts. will produce 2,500 leaves. Were it possible to beat 1 oz. into a single sheet, it would measure about 250 sq. ft. The exhibit illustrates the successive stages in the process, and comprises :— (1) Bar of gold as cast. (2) Ribbon produced by rolling from a similar bar, and ribbon cut in squares. (3) Portion of a cutch, showing gold interleaved. (4) Beaten cutch and quarters produced from same. (5) Shoder with cutch quarters interleaved. (6) Beaten shoder and quarters produced from same.

This producer was patented in 1876 by Messrs. E. Brook & A. Wilson, and was a distinct advance on existing types, embodying as it did a retort portion, an open hearth without firebars, and forced draught. At first the producer was built rectangular in plan, but about 1880 the octagonal form was adopted and the brickwork enclosed in a cylindrical shell of wrought iron, to which doors, etc., could be attached, a construction now universal. The producer is placed in a convenient situation for bringing coal to the level of the staging. The ""slack"" coal is fed through a hopper into the retort, which is in the form of a conical curtain wall, the intention being that the heavier hydrocarbons before reaching the exit holes leading to an annular chamber surrounding the retort, and thus avoid the subsequent deposition of tar in the gas main. The rate of combustion is regulated by the action of an injector, consisting of a steam jet opposite the narrow throat of a tapered vertical pipe. The mixture, in the proportion by weight of about 1 of steam to 20 of air, is delivered at a pressure of 1 to 3 in. of water to a rectangular tuyère, which has three openings at each side in the centre of the hearth, the most economical point. Incomplete combustion takes place with the formation of carbon monoxide; part of the heat evolved, however, is absorbed by the decomposition of the steam. This takes place near the tuyères, keeping that region cool and rendering the clinker brittle. The latter is raked out at intervals of about 24 hrs. through two doors, one on each side of the tuyère, supported by a number of iron bars, driven by belting. This operation requires about half an hour, the producer being shut down meanwhile by the closure of a damper. The gas produced passes off at a temperature of about 430° C. by a pipe leading from the annular chamber, either through a downcomer to an underground flue, or through brick-lined tubes above ground. The average composition of the gas by volume is: CO 24 per cent. ; CO 12.5 per cent. H ; 3.5 per cent. other combustible gases; 5 per cent. CO₂ and 55 per cent. N. About 140,000 cub. ft. are produced for each ton of fuel. The size of the producer shown would gasify upwards of 8 cwt. of coal per hour, or at the rate of about 25 lb. of fuel per sq. ft. of hearth area—i.e., double the rate of Siemens' sloping grate producer.

108,,"1907-138, 31771",Whole,N/A,,,MODEL OF GAS-PRODUCER PLANT,"Made in the Museum from information supplied by The Power-Gas Corporation, Ltd. This shows a plant for making producer gas regeneratively, and recovering the ammonia, the product being suitable for power purposes in large gas engines. An inferior grade of bituminous coal, such as ""slack"" or ""dross,"" is discharged direct from railway wagons into a well, whence it is raised by an elevator and distributed by conveyors to each row of three producers. The fuel is admitted by sliding nets and measuring hoppers to the producers, which are of the form patented in 1893 by Dr. Ludwig Mond, F.R.S.; each consists of a double wrought-iron shell, lined with firebrick, the lower part of the inner shell being formed as a conical grate, and that of the outer shell made to dip into a water seal. Heated air and steam are blown through the annular space between the shells and through the grate, the reaction with the fuel resulting in the formation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, marsh gas, and a trace of ammonia, diluted with nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The heat evolved is, to a great extent, regenerated, and it is in this direction that the Mond system is an advance on previous practice. The ashes sink into the water seal and are raked out at intervals without stopping the production of gas. The temperature of working is kept low, as this is favourable to the production of ammonia and unfavourable to the clinkering of the ash; this is done by using a weight of steam 2.5 times the weight of fuel gasified, but a weight equal to that of the fuel is subsequently recovered. Where the fuel consumed is less than 30 tons per 24 hrs., the expense of ammonia recovery plant is not usually incurred. In that case the weight of steam used is limited to that of the fuel gasified. After leaving the producer the gas passes through a regenerator, which is simply a series of jacketed tubes, the blast of air and steam being in the jacket and the gas inside. It is then delivered to a mechanical washer in the space between the producers. This is a rectangular wrought-iron chamber, where the gas is met by fine spray thrown up by rapidly revolving dashers, driven by belting. The heat of the gas is rendered latent by the formation of steam at a temperature of about 90° C., and the dust and soot, etc., washed out. The tar are removed by an arrangement of lutes in the sides of the washers. The gas then ascends the acid tower through chequer brickwork, over which falls a shower of sulphuric acid in weak solution, the ammonia combining with it to form ammonium sulphate. The acid solution is kept circulating till it contains 36 to 38 per cent. of this salt, when a small stream of the liquor is allowed to run off and is made up by fresh supplies of sulphuric acid. The gas is next passed to the bottom of the gas-cooling tower, where it is met by cold water trickling over wood packing. The water vapour with which it is charged condenses, and this, together with the water that has been used, is pumped to the top of the air-heating tower, where it serves to warm and saturate the air blast on the way to the producers, and is thereby cooled sufficiently for use over again in the gas-cooling tower. A separate building is set apart for the concentration of the ammonium sulphate liquor, after being neutralised, it enters conical vacuum evaporators, heated by steam at 35-lb. pressure in coils of lead piping; the crystals, after being drained, are dried by a hydro-extractor. The quantity realised is about 90 lb. per ton of fuel gasified, but varies with the kind of coal used. There is a power-house to accommodate the Roots blower, water and acid circulating pumps, and an engine for driving the washer. The plant represented is for gasifying 120 tons of fuel per 24 hrs.; 1 ton will produce about 150,000 cub. ft. of gas at ordinary temperature and pressure. The percentage composition by volume averages: Hydrogen, 22; carbon monoxide, 11; marsh gas, 2; the remaining 59.5 per cent. being diluent.

In the forced-draught stationary producer the method of charging the fuel by hopper and bell tends to uneven distribution, which, although counteracted by hand poking, leads to the formation of thin places in the bed and consequent hot spots, hence a reduction in the quality of the gas. This has led to the design of mechanical producers whose essential features are:—
(1) Automatic charging of fuel in small quantities at a time.
(2) Agitation of the fuel bed to prevent the formation of holes.
(3) Automatic removal of the ashes and clinker.
At first these conditions were met by rotating slowly the whole producer, e.g., in the Chapman producer of 1909 there were two portions revolving at slightly different rates, and a counter-balanced “slicing” tube, or rakes, were relied upon for distribution. The next step was to rotate the agitator, as shown, and keep the fuel bed stationary.
The Chapman agitator has a double helix at the upper end that slides vertically in, and is driven by reduction worm gearing from an electric motor at a speed of 1 rev. in 7 mins. By this device, should there be any obstruction, it will rise and pass over it; it will also accommodate itself to varying depths of fuel bed. From the T arm depend six or more fingers, set forward in the direction of rotation. It is found necessary to make these renewable, of carbon steel, and the tube itself of weldless steel. All parts are water-cooled, there being an internal pipe circulation with an outlet at each finger.
The fuel is fed by a hopper into a drum, which has three pockets, each holding 50 to 60 lb. of coal. As the pockets rotate, actuated by a lever and ratchet, they act as coal crushers and discharge into an internal distributing chute. The feed can be varied from zero to 6,000 lb. per hour.
An agitator can be fitted to existing stationary producers, and it is claimed that an increased gasification, varying from 50 per cent. in the poorest grade of fuel to 100 per cent. with producer coal containing 10 per cent. of ash, will be obtained; the quality of the gas will be uniform and a saving in labour will be realised, offset against which must be placed the capital cost of the installation.",,,"[{'name': 'Stein & Atkinson, Ltd.', 'role': 'presenter'}, {'name': 'W.

113,,"Inv. 1921-1024, S.M. 1574",Whole,N/A,,,MODEL OF DORR CYANIDE PLANT,"Scale 1: 48. Made in the Museum from particulars supplied by the Dorr Company, per Messrs. Fraser & Chalmers Engineering Works. The cyanide process is based on the solubility of gold and silver in solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide. The first commercial application was made in 1887–88 by Mr. J. S. MacArthur, R. W. Forrest, and W. Forrest. This was a plant for treating gold ore, erected in 1887 at the Crown Mine, Karangahake, Thames District, New Zealand, and it was closely followed in 1890 by one on the Witwatersrand Goldfields, South Africa. The plant was of the simplest description, consisting of vats with double bottoms, covered with coconut matting, on which the crushed ore rested, and through which the cyanide solution percolated. The leached ore was removed at first by spade work, but later through a manhole in the bottom of the tank. The filter press was introduced for washing out the remaining cyanide solution from the residue ore. Since then developments of the process have been in the direction of making it continuous, coupled with improvements in the mechanical appliances and with agitation by air. The model represents a counter-current decantation plant on the Dorr system, the first application of which was in 1906 at Mogul Mill, Black Hills, South Dakota. It is arranged on the ""step"" plan, which is adopted when, as is often the case, local configuration of the ground does not lend itself to gravitational flow. The plant consists of a series of thickener and agitator tanks, operated in such a manner that thick pulp from the tube mills with a small amount of fresh cyanide solution, made up in volume with clear water, passes successively from one tank to another in series. Barren solution from the precipitation boxes flows in the contrary direction, so that by dilution and decantations the ore is gradually leached of its gold contents while the solution is correspondingly enriched. The thickener, patented in 1917 by Mr. J. van N. Dorr, consists of a circular tank, 45 ft. diam. by 14 ft. deep, with a perforated peripheral launder that collects the solution overflowing at the top. The pulp from the mill is delivered into a short central vertical shaft, provided with a central vertical shaft, provided with a worm gear at the rate of 1 rev. in 10 mins. These arms carry ploughs, set at an angle of about 12 deg. to the horizontal, which push the thickened pulp to a discharge opening in the bottom of the tank. The shaft and arms can be raised by means of a lifting yoke to avoid being set fast in the thickened pulp when it is necessary to shut down. The pulp is elevated from the bottom discharge by ""Dorrco"" adjustable stroke duplex diaphragm pumps, mounted between the tanks on staging, which supports the necessary driving shafts, etc. The speed of the pumps with a 3-in. stroke is 40 r.p.m. The agitator, patented in 1915 by Mr. Dorr, consists of a tank, 25 ft. diam. by 16 ft. deep, with a central vertical cylinder, carried by a shaft supported from the top of the tank and having two radial arms, fitted with ploughs. These arms are hinged so that they can be adjusted to a suitable angle to make the pulp travel slowly towards the centre, where it is raised by compressed air through the vertical cylinder to the revolving launders and distributed uniformly over the surface of the pulp. The speed of these launders is about 5 r.p.m., and they require 0.5 to 0.75 h.p.; 10 to 15 cub. ft. of compressed air per minute at 20-lb. pressure is required. The solution flows into No. 1 thickener, and thence into Nos. 1 and 2 agitators, when the solution of the gold in the pulp is in general completed. The function of the last four thickeners is to wash out the gold-bearing cyanide solution from the solids before they are discharged as tailings from tank No. 5. Make-up clear water, in amount equal to the loss of liquid in the tailings, is added to the last tank along with the barren solution from the precipitation boxes. The overflow from No. 5 thickener passes to No. 4, thence through No. 3 and No. 2 into the small tank solution sump and storage tank. The solution overflows from No. 1 thickener and storage tank to the precipitation boxes, which are shown in a separate model (see No. 107). From 2 lb. to 20 lb. of KCN are required per ton of ore treated, depending on the time of agitation, which varies considerably with different ores. The tonnage output per 24 hrs. with ore of sp. gr. 2·65 in the dry state ranges from about 320 tons with 40 per cent. solution to 160 tons with 75 per cent. solution.

The lead oxidises, and is absorbed by the cupel, together with the copper and other oxidisable metals present, while the silver and gold remain behind in the form of a button (D), which may also contain metals of the platinum group.
3. These buttons are hammered out into discs (E), which after being annealed are rolled into thin strips (F), and these are again annealed and rolled into loose coils, or “cornets” (G). The annealing is carried out in an iron tray.
4. The cornets are placed in small perforated platinum cups, arranged in a perforated tray of the same metal. The whole is then introduced into a platinum boiler, containing boiling nitric acid of specific gravity 1·26, in which it is allowed to remain for 15 mins.; it is then transferred to a similar boiler with acid of specific gravity 1·31. The silver is removed by the action of the acid, and the gold remains in a dark brown spongy state (H). The tray is then removed, washed in a boiler containing boiling distilled water, removed and allowed to dry.
5. The gold spongy mass, which retains the original form of the cornet, is rendered coherent by annealing at a dull red heat. This is done by introducing the platinum tray into the muffle. The cornets then assume the appearance of (I).
6. The final operation consists in weighing the cornet on a special “assay” balance. The weights employed bear a decimal relation to the original weight of metal taken for assay. The percentage of gold, or more usually the “fineness,” is at once indicated without calculation. The weighings are made on the same balance as that used in the first process.",,nitric acid,"[{'name': 'Master of the Mint', 'role': 'lender'}]",[],,gold; silver; lead foil; bone-ash; platinum; nitric acid,specific gravity 1·26; 15 mins.; specific gravity 1·31,"The process of gold assaying comprises six distinct operations.

A definite volume of a strong solution of salt is first added, sufficient to precipitate almost the whole of the silver present. The bottle containing the assay is then vigorously shaken, to coagulate the precipitate and to facilitate settlement.
