A hollow cylindrical bell floats mouth downwards in a vessel containing mercury, and the interior of the bell communicates with the air chamber through a vertical pipe.

It consists of a carriage with a vertical tracing wheel, which can be set with its axis at any required angle to the length of the rod at the end of which it is fixed. The other end of the rod is attached to a carriage which travels along in a straight line, and can slip backwards and forwards so as to adjust itself to the increasing or decreasing distance of the tracing wheel. The two carriages are driven from a common driving wheel by a connection of pulleys and cords. One of them, the centre carriage, has all its wheels set parallel and thus can only move in a straight line; the other, the tracing carriage, has a single wheel attached to a rod which puts the two carriages into relation, and is guided by the setting of its wheel with regard to the rod. As the driving wheel is turned, both carriages are driven; one goes straight forward, and the other goes at a fixed angle to the rod which slides in a guide attached to the first carriage and allows any adjustment of the distance between them that the relative motion of the two carriages demands. In this way the conditions of relation between the motion of air with given incurvature from circular isobars drawn about a moving centre and the motion of the centre are exactly reproduced. With this apparatus, trajectories for various specified conditions can be traced, and the relative speed of the two carriages thus obtained should give the relation between the velocity of the wind and the velocity of the storm centre. In the trajectories shown, the dotted line represents the path of the centre in each case, while a thick line indicates a trajectory.""], ""other"": [""Inv. 1920-731"", ""S.M. 1441"", ""L.S."", ""Lent by Sir Napier Shaw, F.R.S.""]}","{""object_names"": [], ""makers"": [""Napier Shaw, W., Sir"", ""Darwin, Horace, Sir""], ""organisations/institutions"": [""Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company Limited""], ""dates"": [""c. 1918""], ""places"": [""Cambridge, England, United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""Meteorology""], ""other"": [""Sir W.
