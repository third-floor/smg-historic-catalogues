Within the lower part of the main tube is enclosed a second tube tapering downwards and terminating in a small orifice as applied to the siphon barometer by Bunten in the same year, thereby preventing access of air to the vacuum. Correction is made for capacity error by means of an iron plunger, which is of the same diameter as the interior of the barometer tube, and is made to dip into the mercury of the cistern. When the vernier is raised or lowered for taking readings, the plunger is moved simultaneously, but in a contrary direction, by the action of a pinion and a double rack. Thus any decrease or increase in the amount of mercury in the cistern, consequent on a rise or fall of the baro- meter, is compensated by the immersion of the plunger.

By the use of this instrument the flow of a small stream of water over a warm stove is regulated, and by this means a uniform humidity is ensured throughout the building. The hygrometer essentially consists of two bulbs at the extremities of a glass tube, which is connected to a brass rod, the whole turning on a knife edge after the manner of a balance. Mercury fills the tube, and, in part, the bulbs, while in the latter also is a small quantity of ether. One of the bulbs and half of the tube are covered with a paper which is kept constantly moist by water supplied through a pipe above. The knife edge is placed immediately above the covered bulb, beyond which is an arm carrying an adjustable counterpoise, with which the tube is balanced and adjusted, a helical spring serving to regulate the range. In a dry atmosphere, evaporation occurs from the moist paper, producing a decrease of the temperature and causing a contraction of the ether in the covered bulb, which is accompanied by a transference of mercury from the uncovered to the covered bulb, under the influence of the pressure of the ether vapour in the former. The uncovered bulb, being lighter, now rises, and in so doing actuates a lever, opening a valve which allows water to pass through a tube to some heated pipes covered with bibulous paper. By evaporation from these pipes, the amount of moisture in the air is increased until the desired humidity is attained, when the action ceases.

The instrument consists essentially of three portions :— First.—A carriage for holding the two traces from which the third is to be deduced. This carriage is moved from side to side of the instrument by means of a rack and pinion controlled by the operator’s right hand, the line of movement being governed by bevelled wheels running in grooves. To the front of the carriage there is fixed a frame, the upper part of which carries a plate intended to receive the deduced curve. The movement of this plate is therefore similar to that of the two curves to be operated upon. Second.—The second part of the instrument consists of another carriage, having a movement along a track at right angles to that of the first, and carrying a templet with a specially curved surface, corresponding to the required function of the two variables, which in this particular case is the value of the vapour tension for a given temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb. Motion is given to this carriage by a milled head and screw controlled by the operator’s left hand, but an independent movement can be given to the templet from side to side of the carriage by means of another screw at the end of an arm which carries a pair of microscopes arranged to follow the wet and dry bulb traces respectively. Third.—The third section of the instrument is placed immediately above the templet, and consists of a partially counterpoised frame which can move up and down in a set of vertical grooves. The frame terminates in a style which rests lightly upon the templet, whilst at the top it carries a horizontal tube in which slides a pricker, held back in the tube by a spring. When the microscopes have been set so that their cross wires intersect respectively the dry and wet bulb traces, the pricker is struck by a hammer moved by the operator’s foot, and a dot is made on the plate. The distance of this dot below a zero, previously ruled upon the plate, corresponds to the height upon the templet at which the style rests at the moment when the blow is delivered and to the tabular values of the vapour tension for the temperature of the dry bulb and depression of the wet bulb indicated by the two traces.

It was adopted as the international standard instrument by the Innsbruck meeting of the International Conference in 1905. The instrument consists essentially of two similar strips of thin blackened manganin foil, arranged side by side on a small circular ebonite frame, and connectd to two constantan copper thermo-junctions, so that no current will flow if the two strips are at the same temperature. The strips are mounted in a tube provided with three diaphragms, on the front end of which a double walled reversible screen is arranged, which may be used to protect one or other of the strips from external radiations. An ebonite stopper closes the other end of the tube and carries terminals for the thermo-element and the strip. A commutator enables the current to be sent through either strip as required, and a thermometer is fitted to the tube, which may be sighted in any direction. The auxiliary apparatus necessarily consists of a sensitive galvanometer and adjustable resistance, a milliamperemeter and an accumulator, the last three being connected in series with the strip. If now we know the width, resistance, and coefficient of absorption of the strips, we can calculate the absolute value of the radiation, when a balance is obtained, by equating the electrical power absorbed in the screened strip to the radiated power absorbed by the exposed strip, thus:— If $B$=width of strip in cm., $a$=the power of absorption (0.985), $q$=radiation in C.G.S. units, $r$=resistance of unit length of the strips, $i$=strength of electric compensation current: then $baq$=radiated energy, and this is equal to $\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18}$=electrical energy; whence $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba}$ gram calories per second per sq. cm. or $q=\frac{ri^2}{4\cdot18ba} \times 60$ calories per second per sq. cm. Adjustments are provided on the pyrheliometer, by means of which the instrument may be correctly sighted to the sun, this being obtained when the ray of light passing through the pin-hole on the top of the instrument is focussed on the cross-wires. One strip should now be exposed, and the current directed through the other strip and adjusted until no deflection is obtained. The test should then be repeated with the other strip exposed, and the current passing through the one which was previously exposed.

It consists of a short spindle bearing a small set of Robinson's cups and connected with a horizontal cogged wheel resting on friction rollers, also with a long shaft suspended from its centre, as in the anemographs of the British observatories. It is contrived so that the shaft may make 101 complete turns for 200 miles of wind. The mode of recording the miles is as follows:—At the lower end of the shaft is an endless screw which acts on the circumferences of two toothed wheels of equal diameter, turning in vertical planes about a common axis, and having 100 and 101 teeth respectively. From the centre of the back wheel (that of 100 teeth) projects forwards a short hollow pin which encloses and works on a solid pin fixed to a support behind the back wheel. The front wheel (that of 101 teeth) which turns on the above-named hollow pin, and slides closely on the face of the back wheel, has a graduated ring on its face, containing 100 divisions.

Dines for recording the velocity of the wind, is the outcome of a long series of experimental investigations into the relations between the velocity and pressure of the wind, carried out at Horsham in Surrey during the years 1887 to 1894. The anemometer consists of two independent parts: the head, which is the part exposed to the wind, and the recording apparatus, which may be set up in any convenient place indoors, the two portions being connected together by flexible metal tubes. The head consists of a vane formed of a horizontal tube open at one end, and pivoted upon the top of a vertical tube into which it leads. The vane is kept in position with its open end facing the wind, and every increase in wind pressure causes a corresponding increase of the pressure in the vertical or pressure tube. Just below the vane this vertical tube is surrounded by another one of much larger diameter, the exterior of which is perforated by four rings of holes placed close together around its circumference. As the wind passes across these perforations, the air in the tube is sucked out, so that a diminution of pressure results in this tube, which is called the suction tube. The recorder consists of a float, which is a specially-shaped cylindrical copper vessel, closed at one end and inverted in a vessel partially filled with water, and sealed from the air in the room. The interior of the float is in connection with the pressure tube, while the suction tube is connected with the top of the closed vessel containing the float. The two forces thus act together, but in opposite ways, to raise the float in the water. To the top of the float is fixed a rod which carries a pen, the point of which rests against a sheet of paper attached to a drum which is rotated by clockwork. With every upward or downward movement of the float, corresponding to an increase or decrease of wind force, the pen leaves a trace upon the paper, and thus the magnitude of every variation of the strength of the wind is graphically registered, together with the time of its occurrence.",,,"[{'name': 'W.

The rain collected by the gauge passes by the funnel to an oscillating bucket, so made and supported that the weight of a cubic inch will cause it to tilt to discharge its contents. This act of tilting is made use of to record the amount of rain received. The recorder has two dials, graduated to read to cubic inches and hundredths, and is supplied with a train of wheels, the movement of which is controlled by the armature of a pair of electro-magnets. The gauge, the recorder and a battery being connected by wires, the oscillation of the bucket completes the circuit, and the electro-magnets, acting by their armature, move forward the hand on the dial.

1. *Cirrus.*—These extensive curved threads, exhibit the familiar wisps and form part of a huge plume of cirrus.
2. *Cirrus.*—Tufts of cirrus with extremely delicate thread-like continuations. The cirrus is moving in the direction in which the lines are lying, the tufts preceding, and the tails following.
3. *Cirrus.*—In this irregular thread-like cloud, long threads can be seen along which there occur nuclei from which other threads spread outwards more or less transversely to the main threads.
4. *Cirro-stratus.*—Part of a widely spread sheet of dense cirro-stratus, a considerable height above the cumulus clouds along the horizon. The straight edge of the cloud is noticeable.
5. *Cirro-cumulus.*—An example of the variety termed “speckle-cloud”; the globules of cloud are excessively minute toward the edges of the sheet, where they become mixed with very delicate threads of cirrus.
6. *Cirro-cumulus.*—Part of a sheet of fine globular cirro-cumulus which exhibits double undulation, the transverse system being rather irregular. This example formed very rapidly from a previously uniform cloud-sheet.
7. *Cirro-cumulus.*—Here cirro-cumulus cloudlets are shown massing together into an irregular waved form.
8. *Cirro-cumulus Lenticularis.*—A very large compound lenticular cloud-bank with several small detached single clouds. This photograph shows a wonderful sunset effect upon the rippled under surface of the cloud bank. The system of double undulation shown by the ripples is remarkable.
9. *Alto-stratus.*—The characteristic grey pall of intermediate cloud through which the sun is shining weakly. Some loose “scud” in dark ragged masses—the forerunners of the coming nimbus—may be seen moving up below the alto-stratus. This is an example wherein the alto-stratus is quite structureless.
10. *Alto-cumulus.*—An example of cloudlets without shadows; in this case the waves are sinuous instead of straight. The thinness of the cloud-layer is very obvious, especially on the left-hand side of the picture, but this was the case only at the edge of the layer, at the point where the photograph was taken. Farther to the right, the cloudlets were much denser and showed the normal shadowed appearance.
11. *Alto-cumulus.*—The most typical form of alto-cumulus, all the characteristics of that cloud-type as described in the International classification being present in this picture. The two wave-systems crossing each other (“double undulation”) are very clearly shown, and the solid character of the cloudlets is well brought out by the slight shadows upon them.
12. *Alto-cumulus Lenticularis.*—A series of these cloud-banks well depicted at sunset. The relatively great density of the central parts is plainly to be seen, as also is the comparative thinness at their edges. In the upper part of the photograph, the individual cloudlets are seen passing out of one bank and entering another. The proper method of distinguishing between cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus when they are massed into banks of this type is to examine the individual cloudlets that are nearest to the observer, for the banks themselves give very little indication of any difference when they are at all dense or very distant.
13. *Strato-cumulus.*—The typical form of this cloud. The masses are heavily shaded, and tend to fuse into each other within the sheet, while at the edges of the sheet they appear separated, so that the blue of the sky can be seen between them.
14. *Strato-cumulus.*—This is a heavier form of strato-cumulus, and is the type of cloud sheet that may cover the whole sky for days together, especially during the winter months. The cloud is dark grey with bright yellowish-white interstices where the sun is shining through the thinner parts of the sheet. The edges of the clouds are fused together; little or no blue sky can be seen between them.
15. *Cumulus.*—Typical cumulus clouds. The dome-shaped or pyramidal structure is very evident in the smaller one, and protuberances which indicate rising currents may be seen, while the flatness of the dark base which marks the level of condensation is also well shown.
16. *Cumulus (and Fracto-cumulus).*—Small cumulus clouds mixed with a considerable amount of the broken variety known as fracto-cumulus. The latter form seems to be accompanied by much turbulence and is found often in squally weather. 17. Cumulo-nimbus. - A large thunder-cloud with a very flat base from which rain is falling in the far distance. In the near front of the cloud-mass the moisture in the rising currents is condensing and spreading out into a large ""anvil"" which is fringed with false cirrus threads. Far in the rear there may be seen more false cirrus from other parts of the cloud-mass, which latter seems to be formed by the union of several cumulo-nimbus clouds. 18. Cumulo-nimbus. - This is an example showing rapidly-growing vertical columns of cloud that are uniting to form a huge thunder-cloud, of which this photograph includes less than one-fourth. A quantity of loose fracto-cumulus is floating round the main mass. 19. Cumulo-nimbus. - This hail squall cloud is moving from left to right and showers are falling from it over the sea. As the cloud moves forward the rising moist air forms in front of it a line of growing cumulus which lies round the front of the main cloud like a collar. 20. Cumulo-nimbus. - An advancing hail shower cloud, showing some growing cumulus in front. The passage of the cloud overhead was accompanied by a heavy squall with hail. 21. Nimbus. - Actually a shower falling from the nimbus-base of a large cumulo-nimbus cloud. It is impossible to photograph the typical nimbus cloud because the rain, when general, is not visible to the camera. It is only when an isolated shower shows dark against the lighter sky beyond that the rain can be shown. 22. Stratus. - This is the really typical form of stratus, a grey pall of cloud without any detail, and rendered visible only by the fact that the summit of the distant hill is immersed in the cloud, which is trailing along its flanks in the ragged masses called fracto-stratus. 23. Line Squall Front. - This shows the line of cumulus cloud losing its cumuli-form character, and beginning to show some vertical arrangement, while small wisps of condensation were moving up and down below the cloud front. 24. Nimbus with Rainbow. - A screen of rain is falling and a primary rainbow with a very faint outer secondary bow base becomes visible. Inv. 1921-17.",,,"[{'name': 'G. A.

This is an example showing rapidly-growing vertical columns of cloud that are uniting to form a huge thunder-cloud, of which this photograph includes less than one-fourth. A quantity of loose fracto-cumulus is floating round the main mass. This hail squall cloud is moving from left to right and showers are falling from it over the sea. As the cloud moves forward the rising moist air forms in front of it a line of growing cumulus which lies round the front of the main cloud like a collar. An advancing hail shower cloud, showing some growing cumulus in front. The passage of the cloud overhead was accompanied by a heavy squall with hail. Actually a shower falling from the nimbus-base of a large cumulo-nimbus cloud. It is impossible to photograph the typical nimbus cloud because the rain, when general, is not visible to the camera. It is only when an isolated shower shows dark against the lighter sky beyond that the rain can be shown. This is the really typical form of stratus, a grey pall of cloud without any detail, and rendered visible only by the fact that the summit of the distant hill is immersed in the cloud, which is trailing along its flanks in the ragged masses called fracto-stratus. This shows the line of cumulus cloud losing its cumuli-form character, and beginning to show some vertical arrangement, while small wisps of condensation were moving up and down below the cloud front. A screen of rain is falling and a primary rainbow with a very faint outer secondary bow base becomes visible.",,1921,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 1, 'terms': ['scud']}"

Strato-cumulus with tops at 5,000 ft. over France. - Strato-cumulus with tops at 5,000 ft. over France. In the distance clouds and haze can be seen on the horizon over England, while over the Channel it is clearer. The form of the clouds indicates turbulence, which is due in this case to heating at the surface. Immediately above the clouds the dry bulb temperature rose from 45° to 53°, and that of the wet bulb fell from 45° to 53°, the relative humidity thus suddenly falling to 23 per cent. 2. Low strato-cumulus cloud. - Low strato-cumulus cloud, with another larger one in the background. The density and great thickness of the cloud may be seen from the large dark shadow in the foreground. 3. Cumulus cloud growing up through a cloud sheet. - This photograph shows the top of a cumulus cloud growing up through a cloud sheet. The upper surface of the cloud sheet was at 8,000 ft. and the cumulus reached 11,000 ft. In this case there was no temperature inversion below 11,000 ft. The conditions being those of a cool westerly type within a depression. This combination of clouds is commonly seen, but if there is a temperature inversion above the clouds, the cumuli do not stand out so boldly, and when growing through a thin cloud sheet often break up altogether, particularly if the humidity above the clouds is low. 4. Cloud forced up from the lower air when the upper air was in a stable condition. - This illustrates the top of a cloud forced up from the lower air when the upper air was in a stable condition. Underneath are dense clouds of the strato-cumulus type, and some showers, while at 8,000 ft. the clouds were 5° F. colder than the air at that level. The cloud seen in the photograph reached an altitude of 13,000 ft., and was associated with the passage of a very small V-shaped secondary. 5. Row of large towering cumuli. - Row of large towering cumuli forming the summits of rising air columns the highest of which has risen to over 10,000 ft. 6. Large cumulus towering from 1,000 to 11,000 ft. - Large cumulus towering from 1,000 to 11,000 ft. This cloud is the same as that on the left of No. 5 and was photographed five mintues later from a distance of only two or three miles. The tops of the rising air columns are seen remarkably well in this view. 7. This photograph illustrates three cloud summits towering vertically upwards from a layer with an unstable lapse rate of temperature. It is a form not uncommon with cold west or north-west winds. There were a large number of cumulus clouds between 2,000 ft. and 3,000 ft. and some of those that reached the unstable layer above 4,000 ft. grew up very rapidly, but the tops were broken off in every case. The tops of these clouds were at an altitude of 7,800 ft. at which ""Inversion"" occurred, thereby preventing their further growth. 8. The tops of the towering cumuli of No. 7 soon became detached and are shown in this photograph. The intervening parts of the cloud pillars have evaporated and cumuli may be seen below, while in the background there is a cloud layer at an altitude of about 7,000 ft. just below the inversion. 9. - The towering cumuli of No. 7, the tops of which are shown detached in No. 8, are here seen several minutes later, when the detached fragments are dissolving, and rapidly disappearing. 10. Cumulo-nimbus (thunder-cloud) - Cumulo-nimbus (thunder-cloud), up to 20,000 ft. with dense masses of lower cloud in the foreground. The top of the cloud consisted of snow and was photographed from an altitude of 12,000 ft. 11. - A long narrow strip of cloud riddled into waves, and formed in a damp layer at 4,000 ft., the wave-length being from 150 to 200 yards. The strip lay along the current at its level, and the waves were across the current. Below may be seen a large number of small cumulus which had formed at 1,000 to 1,500 ft. from a sheet of stratus. As there was an inversion of 30° F. above the cloud but none above the clear area to south-east, it appears that there was a marked local increase of wind velocity just above the strip which gave rise to the waves. 12. - A view taken from 13,000 ft. showing snow showers from the high clouds. The lower clouds were forced up in a high bank of which the round top on the right was part. On the east side of the bank there was strato-cumulus up to 6,500 ft. with an inversion of 3° above it, while on the west there was strato-cumulus with no inversion. The bank was apparently forced up as the result of colder air arriving near the surface. 13. - Parallel rolls of cloud, two or three miles apart and approximately forty miles long, covering the Boulogne region of France, and a portion of the Channel. The rolls were in lines from south-west to north-east, but the actual motion was from west-south-west. A portion of the coast line is visible through the nearest gap. The clouds were at an altitude of 4,000 ft. to 4,500 ft. and there were other layers higher up. 14. - A nearer view of two parallel rolls of cumulus cloud. 15. - A portion of a long narrow irregular strip of cumulus photographed from 13,000 ft. The strip which was 20-30 miles long was caused by the spread of a surface breeze from north-west to west-north-west, but the clouds moved themselves with the south-west current. The cloud was evidently due to upward movement originating near the surface, as the clouds were 2° colder than the air at their level elsewhere, and were extraordinarily turbulent. 16. - A close view of the upper surface of a turbulent sheet of strato-cumulus. The top of the sheet was 5,000 ft. high and an inversion of 10° F. occurred above it, but the clouds were forced upwards in a few places in spite of this large temperature inversion. These upward currents were due partly to an unstable lapse rate of temperature in the clouds and partly to complicated wind currents near the ground. 17. - The top of a strato-cumulus cloud sheet at a height of 9,700 ft. considerably above the average height of this particular type of cloud. The cloud billows are very clearly shown, one system of waves or folds crossing the other at an angle of about 30°. There was an inversion of 3° above this cloud sheet, a thin layer at 10,000 ft. and more turbulent clouds lower down at 9,000 ft. 18. - Layer of strato-cumulus with the upper surface at an altitude of 2,500 ft. Ripples can be seen crossing the current obliquely, while a straight bank is also visible in the background. 19. Strato-cumulus sheet - Strato-cumulus sheet moving west-south-west, with the camera pointing south. The clouds were at an altitude of 4,500-5,000 ft. and there was only a very slight temperature inversion above them. 20. Strato-cumulus sheet - Strato-cumulus sheet with well-marked furrows. The waves are close together and are probably therefore across the current, but slightly oblique to it. Similar but rather larger waves are common along the current but are also frequently slightly oblique.

Mansell Pleydell and G. T. Bennett, Esq., F.R.S., and known as the Bennett-Pleydell principle, by which the height of an object is determined, as distinct from its range, by the measurement of two angles only. This instrument was designed in 1916 by Dr. E. M. Rayner, and consists of two stations, one at each end of a base a mile long. At each station there is a wooden stand holding a rectangular sighting frame capable of rotation about a horizontal axis. At one end of each instrument is a dial and pointer arrangement giving at once the angle between the horizontal plane, and the plane of the sighting wire attached to the rotating framework. At the other end of one instrument (that exhibited) is a ""plotting board,"" rigidly attached to the upright and engraved with a series of equidistant horizontal lines marked in thousands of feet. In addition to these lines there is a semicircular scale of degrees over which a loose arm may be swung at will. Rigidly attached to the rotating framework is a second arm. The inner edge of each of these arms passes through its own axis of rotation, and the distance between these axes represents the distance between the ""home"" and ""distant"" instruments on the same scale as the vertical distance between either axis, and any one of the horizontal lines represents the height marked on that line. In measuring the height, of an aerial object the sighting frames at both stations are turned so that the plane of each wire rectangle passes through the object. The angle of elevation of the ""distant"" plane is then telephoned to the ""home"" station and the free arm is set to this angle on the plotting board. The arm fixed to the ""home"" frame automatically gives the same information for the ""home"" station, and, in fact, the triangle formed by the inner edges of the two arms, with the horizontal line passing through their axes of rotation, is a reproduction to scale of the triangle formed by the lines joining the two stations and the target. Hence the height of the object sighted may be at once read off from the position of the intersection point of these arms. In practice several observations a minute can be made. A suitable length for the base is one to two miles. This apparatus was the first to be generally installed in the war for air defence.

230,No. 2,1921-594,Whole,N/A,ELECTRICAL HEIGHT FINDER,loaned,ELECTRICAL HEIGHT FINDER (No. 2),"This instrument which depends upon the Bennett-Pleydell “roof” principle was devised in 1916 at the National Physical Laboratory by Messrs. C. C. Paterson and J. W. T. Walsh in order to enable a continuous indication of the height of an aerial target to be obtained. The complete installation consists of a height indicator, an electrical circuit and two transmitters, one of which is fitted with a plotting board and pointers. At each station, enclosed in a semicircular iron tank is a uniform resistance supported horizontally at a fixed distance below the axis of the sighting frame, and with its centre directly under this axis. Attached rigidly to the axle of this frame, and in continuation of the plane of the sighting wires, is a phosphor-bronze bar which presses against the horizontal resistance. In this way the distance between the centre of the resistance and the point of contact of the bar is always proportional to the cotangent of the angle of elevation of the sighting frame. Thus if it be arranged that there is a constant current passing through the resistance, the difference of electrical potential between the bar and the centre of the resistance is also proportional to this quantity. By means of a local battery, voltmeter and regulating rheostat, the voltage drop across a given length of resistance is maintained at the same constant value at both home and distant stations. The distances between the axes of rotation of the sighting frame and the horizontal tracks of the phosphor-bronze bars on the resistances are also the same at both stations, so that by connecting line conductors between the stations in such a manner as to put the two voltage differences in series, a milliammeter with a suitable swamping resistance in the circuit gives at once a reading proportional to the difference of the cotangents of the two sighting angles. It follows that in order to obtain a direct reading of height, the instrument must be provided with a reciprocal scale. For the purpose of increasing the range, two scales are provided; one from 1,600 to 5,000 ft., and the other from 5,000 to 20,000 ft. The more open scale is brought into operation by pressing a key switch which normally short-circuits a shunt to the moving coil of the instrument. The series resistance of the milliammeter is variable, and is so adjusted in relation to (i) the actual voltages employed at the two stations, (ii) the sensitivity of the milliammeter, and (iii) the ratio of the base length to the vertical distance between the axes of the sighting frames and their respective resistances, that a given base length corresponds with a definite series resistance for all instruments. Corresponding values are tabulated in the instrument box, and so any instrument can be used with any length of base by suitably adjusting the series resistance. The chief errors to which the instrument is liable are (i) leakage in the insulation of the main conductors between the stations, and (ii) change of resistance of these conductors with change of temperature. On this latter account these conductors are required to be as heavy as possible so that their resistance may be properly swamped by the series resistance of V. (See Pat. Specn. No. 4379 of 1916.)

Dines, F.R.S., for use with registering balloons (*ballons-sondes*), produces a record of air pressure and temperature from which the altitude can be computed. It has been adopted by the Meteorological Offices of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, and, with some modifications, by that of India. The meteorograph consists essentially of a small aneroid box mounted in a light frame, one side of the frame carrying a small thin plate on which the record is made, and the other side the recording pens. The plate is electro-plated with copper, and then silver, thereby producing a surface which is free from scratches, and which is not susceptible to corrosion. The thermograph depends for its action on the relative contraction of a strip of thin German silver as compared with the invar steel rod on which it is supported. This motion is multiplied by a lever mounted across the ends of the strips, and communicated to a scratching point, which writes upon the metal record. To facilitate measurement, a second pointer is attached to the invar rod. The fall of pressure is determined by the expansion of an aneroid box, which moves the recording point over the metal record in a direction at right angles to that given by change of temperature. During the descent of the instrument, the points are lifted clear of the plate by an automatic arrangement at a point where the pressure is about 0.95 mgd. per sq. cm. (28 in. of mercury). In this way, the last 500 m. of the descent is lost, but a record is obtained which is free from blur. The instrument is protected by a bright metal case, and is well ventilated, so as to eliminate the effect of solar radiation. Before the ascent, the meteorograph is calibrated by causing the pen to make marks upon the metal record corresponding with known temperatures and pressures, over the range required. After an ascent has been made, the plate is placed upon the micrometer stage of a special microscope, and corresponding values of temperature and pressure experienced during the ascent can be deter- mined by comparing the record with the calibration marks.

The instruments by which records are taken are attached to a light board, 12 in. by 15 in., which is suspended to a box kite. On the board is also a circular sheet of paper ruled for recording purposes, and a small clock for rotating the paper. The apparatus for air-pressure and wind-force are set on one side of the clock, those for temperature and humidity on the other, and the writing apparatus is carried at the ends of light levers in connection with the four instruments. The pressure instrument consists of an ordinary aneroid box, to the centre of which is fixed a knife-edge which, as pressure is reduced, pushes forward the lever which carries the pen. On any rise of pressure a spring keeps the lever in contact with the knife-edge so that it follows the backward movement of the aneroid case. The temperature instrument is formed of a long spiral of copper tubing which is set at the back of board. This tube opens into a small aneroid box containing alcohol. To the centre of this box is fixed a knife-edge which acts on the recording lever in much the same way as in the air-pressure instrument. The humidity apparatus consists of a bundle of hairs at the back of the board, the elongation and shortening of which move the recording lever in one direction or the other over the dial. For wind-force there is at the back of the instrument an arm to which can be attached a celluloid ball of 3 in. diam. and 100 grns. weight.

It is a baro-thermo-hygro-anemograph, the barometer of which is a large double aneroid with steel boxes. The thermometer consists of two annular Bourdon tubes of very thin steel filled with alcohol, and the hygrometer consists of two bundles of hair. The thermometer tubes and hygrometer hairs are enclosed in a polished tube open at both ends. The anemometer originally used was a small instrument of the Robinson cup pattern, operating through an electro-magnet on a small hammer and recording on the drum in steps. In later patterns the anemometer was replaced by an Assmann anemometer, designed on the Woltmann fly wheel anemometer principle. It consists of an eight-bladed fan fitting into the end of the aspiration tube and operating through a train of cogwheels on the marking pen. The instrument when used with the anemometer is suspended by a wire some distance below the kite to avoid any disturbing effect due to the latter.

Employing this method he studied the weather during December, 1861, over the greater portion of Europe, plotting three charts for each day, from which he deduced the existence of high pressure regions which he called “anti-cyclones.” In these charts of barometric pressure, a pressure of 29·20 or less is indicated by black disc, and between 29·21 and 29·45 by a black star. A black circle with a centre indicates between 29·46 and 29·70, and one without centre between 29·71 and 29·95, while red circle without centre represents a pressure between 29·96 and 30·20 and with a red centre from 30·21 to 30·45. Pressures from 30·46 to 30·70 are indicated by a red star, and above that value by a red disc. On the chart for 1st December, the barometric depression is seen to be travelling from west to east, while the winds are circulating around the minimum pressure region in an anti-clockwise direction, and the temperature in general is high. The chart for 2nd December shows a wind circulating in a clockwise direction round a high pressure region, accompanied by a considerable fall of temperature.
