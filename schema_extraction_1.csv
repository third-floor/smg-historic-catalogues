In machine telegraphy an operator transmits messages by playing on a keyboard, and the whole of the rest of the work is done by machinery, the chief mechanism being the telegraph printer at the receiving station. The central principle in all such machines is that of the key and lock. There is a separate key and a separate lock for each letter. The keys are assembled in the transmitting keyboard, and the locks, which are at the receiving station, form a “selector” which operates the typewriter. In modern telegraph printers the permutation lever lock is used combined with what is known as the five-unit alphabet. As about 32 of these permutation lever locks are required for letters and operation signals, they are arranged in a circle or in a straight line. The circular form was the first to come into practical use in the type-writing telegraphs, culminating in the Baudot Multiplex in 1875. The straight-line plan was old, but was first put into practical form by Mr. Donald Murray in Sydney, Australia, in 1898, in the models which are here exhibited. The preliminary wooden model, which was made in 1896, shows the essential features of all subsequent machines of the straight-line class, including the Murray automatic printer adjacent to it. This printer was taken to New York in 1901, and was developed with the assistance of the Postal Telegraph Co. into the Murray automatic printing telegraph system. This was brought to London in 1901, and after further improvement was used by the British, German, Russian and other administrations. The Murray automatic system was combined with the Baudot multiplex by Murray, with the assistance of the British Post Office, between the years 1907 and 1912, the result being the Murray multiplex (a combined Automatic-Multiplex system). From this has developed the Western Union Multiplex, the Western Electric Multiplex and the Morkrum multiplex.

Nevertheless, it worked perfectly at over 200 words per minute with type fixed by means of seccotine to type-bars made from umbrella ribs. The type-bars are supported between two toothed discs gearing with pinions on a motor shaft, which slowly revolves. Between the discs is a drum, which is stationary, and has a series of sloping grooves terminated by cam surfaces. Each type-bar has five setting pins friction-tight in the bar and arranged to be set by five magnets. The positioning of a type-bar depends upon the setting of its pins, which are spaced apart at distances, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 units, each unit being equal to the width of a single type. The bars are adjusted to the printing position by means of the setting pins engaging as the bar rotates with sliding grooves. In this way the required letter is at the printing point after the bar has travelled 180° from the setting point. The setting of the bar is therefore a very leisurely process, and in this respect alone the printer is unique. Each pin, after passing through a groove, is reset by a sloping cam surface on the stationary drum, while each type-bar has a small lug on its underside, which comes in contact with a sloping reset plate after passing the printing point.

The perforated tape, containing a batch of three or four messages, having been prepared, the next step is automatic transmission, that is to say, collection of the space signals and transmission as time signals. There are two well-known methods of accomplishing this. The first is the direct method, in which metallic brushes make electrical contact through the holes of the paper tape. In the second, or indirect, method, the signals are transmitted by the intervention of a number of small levers and rods controlled by the tape. This method, which is similar in principle to the Jacquard loom, was first used in the Wheatstone automatic transmitter, and experience has shown it to be the best. It is used in the present case.
The name of the instrument is derived from the fact that the slip perforations are in a single row. The transmitter automatically sends out a train of five currents impulse of a time, corresponding to one letter or character, with distinct pauses between each train.
With regard to any one train, if there is no current perforation in the corresponding five centre hole length of slip, the five current impulses are all negative, actually forming one continuous negative current. If, however, one or more perforations occur, the corresponding current impulses to line are positive in direction and the remainder of the five are negative.

The essential features of the Murray printer have been described in the label which accompanied the original models. The tape is fed along letter by letter (five units at a time) by a star-wheel carried on a shuttle, which is kept reciprocating by means of a cam. Each reciprocation rotates the star-wheel one letter space. The shuttle carries a die-plate coinciding with the circumference of the star-wheel and having five holes corresponding with the message holes in the tape. Five rods, fixed in the ends of five slotted combs, are free to enter the five holes in the die-plate if they are not obstructed by the paper tape which passes between the rods and the plate. On its inward stroke the shuttle with its die-plate presses the tape against the ends of the rods and those that are opposite holes in the tape pass through into the die-plate. By this means one particular group of slots in the combs, and only one out of 56, is brought into alignment so that a cross-bar can drop into it and cause a letter to print.

The instrument here shown, which is due to Messrs.

The relay mentioned was designed to overcome the difficulty of securing sufficiently good electrical contact under the slight pressure obtainable from an instrument actuated by weak arrival currents at the end of a long cable. The point of a contact arm (representing the siphon in the ordinary form of recorder) was caused to traverse the cylindrical surface of a rapidly rotating drum. This surface was divided into two parallel halves by a short insulating space on which the arm normally rested, so that two separate conducting surfaces were provided, with either of which the arm would make contact in its excursions from the central position.
The special form of curb sender here shown is designed to secure the correct retransmission of any given number of consecutive elements of a letter which are of the same sign, but which signals are received at the end of a long cable; the relay arm will not return to its zero position between consecutive elements of the same sign, but will remain on the respective contact surface during the whole time occupied by such consecutive elements.
The instrument consists of two cams, the form of which regulates the component of the curb-fed signal, one cam being for the dot element and the other for the dash. These cams, by means of clutches controlled by the relay, are mechanically rotated by clockwork, the speed of rotation being approximately adjusted to the rate of transmission of a single element; so that the requisite number of consecutive elements is transmitted, corresponding to the duration of contact of the relay arm with the side controlling that particular element.

It is continuously loaded with a new magnetic alloy, developed by the Western Electric Co., which strengthens the magnetic field 2,000 times. It represents the first radical change in submarine cable construction for more than 50 years. In contrast to the other electrical industries, the development of submarine cables has been slow and conservative, owing to the great expense involved in any large-scale experiments. In 1887 the late Oliver Heaviside investigated the problems raised by the large capacity of long cables, and showed how the effects could be counteracted by the insertion of loading coils. In 1899 the suggestion was taken up by Pupin, who gave practical details for this method, but it was not until 1906 that the first Pupinised underwater cable was laid, in Lake Constance. In 1902 it was proposed by Krarup for loading the cable continuously by wrapping an iron wire round the copper conductor, but the losses in ordinary iron were found to offset the gains, so that the method was never extensively used, while it was found impossible to surmount the mechanical difficulties of jointing, &c., for the use of Pupin coils in deep-sea cables. The discovery of “Permalloy,” a heat-treated nickel-iron alloy having a permeability 2,000 as great as ordinary iron, has made it possible to revert to continuous loading. The alloy is made in the form of tape, 6/100ths in. thick, and is wound immediately over the copper core. An experimental length of 120 miles of cable loaded in this manner was submerged to a depth of 2½ miles at Bermuda on the 13th October, 1923, and this having proved entirely satisfactory, the full 2,300 miles necessary for an Atlantic cable were manufactured forthwith. The counteraction of capacity effect given by the new form of loading has resulted in a manifold increase in the traffic capacity, while it is stated that there is no limit to the length of cable which could now be operated without intermediate relays. The possibilities in the Pacific Ocean are greater than in the Atlantic, as fewer facilities exist there already.

Lent by The Institution of Electrical Engineers. 1863 This instrument, made in 1863, was invented by Philipp Reis of Frankfurt for the transmission and reception by electrical means of all kinds of sounds. Since it definitely succeeded in this, the invention is generally held to be the first electric telephone. / From his published work it appears that Reis fully understood the fundamental principles involved in the electrical transmission and reception of sounds, and although his apparatus was less perfect than that of later inventors, it was undoubtedly capable of transmitting articulate speech as well as musical sounds. / Reis named his apparatus the “Telephon.” He probably designed ten distinct forms of transmitter and four forms of receiver. The apparatus here shown embodies the final forms of each. The transmitter consists of a hollow cube of wood having a circular opening in the lid which is closed by an elastic membrane (pig's lesser intestine). Upon the centre of this membrane is glued a little plate of platinum, which is connected with one terminal by a thin metal strip. Upon the middle of the platinum plate rests a short platinum pencil fastened to the underside of an angular metal strip. At one end of this strip a platinum spike on the underside rests in a mercury cup while the other end rests upon a metal pillar connected with a second terminal. / On speaking into the mouthpiece of the instrument the membrane vibrates and produces loose-contact phenomena between the platinum plate and the pencil. That these were intended to give a following-contact and not a clean break seems likely from the inventor’s writings and from the design of his other transmitters, in all of which some form of following-contact is formed. / On the side of the resonating box a simple telegraph apparatus is placed for the purpose of supplementing the telephone communications. / The receiver consists of a resonating box on the top of which is placed a long solenoid wound on a wooden bobbin. Through the centre of this a steel knitting-needle is thrust. A hinged lid closes over the solenoid. / The changes in the magnetic state of the needle occasioned by the speech-varied current create vibrations which are communicated to the resonant box, the original sounds being reproduced with sufficient distinctness to be heard by anyone placing his ear to the box.

The main features of the instrument, the carbon transmitter and electromotograph (see adjacent exhibit), were patented by Edison in 1877. The transmitter, used—the parent of all modern transmitters—consists essentially of a button of soft carbon, about 3/8 in. in diameter, placed between two brass discs. One of these discs has a small glass centre, against which presses a brass stud fixed to the sheet iron diaphragm. The two brass discs are connected with the terminals of the instrument. Speech into the mouth-piece causes the diaphragm to vibrate, and produces variations in the resistance of the button and corresponding variations in the current transmitted through the line. The receiver, or “electromotograph,” has a small chalk cylinder, which is kept moistened with potassium iodide, and which is rotated by a handle through worm gearing. A brass diaphragm carries at its centre a brass strip spring, holding a platinum contact piece, which presses lightly against the chalk cylinder, the spring being tangential to the cylinder. The amount of friction exerted on the platinum contact by the rotating cylinder varies with the current passing to it from the sender, and this causes the spring and diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrations are damped by an indiarubber pad, the pressure of which against the back of the spring may be adjusted by a screw. This receiver, although loud and clear, required too much attention, and was abandoned after the amalgamation of the Edison and Bell Companies in 1880. Within the box, on which the transmitter is fitted, is an induction coil with three windings, and the mechanism seen above the box is a relay for the bell. There are also two keys, one for ringing and the other for closing the local microphone circuit. When the ringing key is up, the relay and the “tertiary” of the induction coil are connected in series between line and earth. Depressing the relay key breaks this connection and substitutes the battery between the line and earth. The microphone circuit is made up of the microphone, two cells of the battery, microphone key and primary of the induction coil.

120,,1908-187,Whole,N/A,GOWER-BELL TELEPHONES,,GOWER-BELL TELEPHONES,"Patented in 1880. Owing to the very small electric currents developed in the magnetic telephone as arranged by Graham Bell (Inv. 1906–10), it could be used efficiently as a transmitter over comparatively short distances only. Transmitters were consequently introduced in which currents from batteries were utilised, and the acoustical effects were employed to produce variations of the resistances of the circuits. Undulating currents were thus obtained, which, by means of magnetic receivers, were made to reproduce the exciting sounds. At first the transmitter and its battery were placed in circuit with the line wire and the distant receiver, and as the variations in resistance produced in the transmitter were small compared with the total resistance, the changes in the current were correspondingly small. This difficulty was overcome by using an induction coil, the primary of which was in circuit with the transmitter and battery, while the secondary was connected with the line. T. A. Edison in 1877 constructed an instrument of this type, the action of which depended upon changes in the resistance of carbon with variations of pressure, while, in 1878, Prof. D. E. Hughes introduced his ""microphone"" (Cat. Nos. 100 and 101), which utilised the variation of the resistance of substances in loose contact placed in the neighbourhood of the sounds to be reproduced. Carbon was found to be the most suitable material, and many forms of carbon transmitters embodying the principle of Hughes's apparatus are now employed. The instruments shown are of a type which was used in the British Post Office, in which a carbon transmitter, patented by Mr. F. A. Gower in 1880, is employed. This consists of eight carbon pencils, supported between eight carbon blocks and one central block, all the blocks being recessed to receive loosely the reduced ends of the pencils. Four of the outside blocks are connected by means of a copper strip with one terminal of the battery, while the remaining four are connected, through the primary of an induction coil, with the other. The blocks are mounted upon a thin deal board, which constitutes the diaphragm and is enclosed in a wooden casing fitted with a porcelain mouth-piece.",,,"[{'name': 'Graham Bell', 'role': 'Inventor'}, {'name': 'T.

Means must be provided whereby a subscriber on any automatic exchange may connect himself with any subscriber on his own or any other exchange, and the connection must be made in such a manner as to make the most economical use of lines and automatic switches. Moreover, during the period of transition which must elapse before the whole system has been converted to automatic working, special apparatus must be provided to deal with calls between the existing manual exchanges and the new automatic exchanges. After a prolonged study of the problem, the British Post Office Authorities have decided that the system to be installed in the London Area shall be based on the well-known Step-by-Step system, with the addition of the important “Director” principle. The function of the Director is to receive and store the subscriber’s call in its original form, and to proceed to send it out into the exchange switching mechanism, translated into any trains of impulses which may be required by the existing lay-out of junction routes and switching centres. Having steered the call through, link by link, to the line of the required subscriber, the director disconnects itself from the line and becomes available for other calls. Another important feature of the system is the Coder Call Indicator. This switchboard is the connecting link between a subscriber on an automatic exchange and a subscriber served from a manual exchange.

The cable is arranged for superposing, and three speaking circuits are obtained from the two pairs of conductors.",,,"[{'name': 'Siemens Bros. & Co., Ltd.', 'role': 'manufacturer'}, {'name': 'Siemens Bros.', 'role': 'manufacturer'}]",['Belgium'],1911,copper;gutta-percha,160 lb. per naut,"designed to increase the speaking efficiency between this country and Belgium; The specimen shows a short length of cable on each side of a loading point; This di-electric has much less leakance than ordinary gutta-percha at telephonic frequencies, and is especially suitable for coil-loaded submarine cables; The cable is arranged for superposing, and three speaking circuits are obtained from the two pairs of conductors.",,1911,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 0, 'terms': []}"

144,,1925-403,Whole,N/A,THE TRANSMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OVER LONG TELEPHONE LINES,,THE TRANSMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OVER LONG TELEPHONE LINES,"An examination of these telephotographs will show the degree of technical excellence to which the transmission of pictures over long telephone lines has now been carried. The system, which has been worked out over a period of several years by the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. and the Western Electric Co., represents the association of numerous modern inventions, such as the thermionic tube and the carrier-current transmission system, with the fundamental device known as a photo-electric cell. The simplicity of the method is such that a positive transparency, prepared by any photographer, may be sent while still wet over lines practically of any length in a few minutes, and after photographic development of the usual sort it is ready for newspaper or other reproduction. A photographic film, which is a transparent positive of the picture to be transmitted, is rolled inside a transparent cylinder. The cylinder and film are rotated at uniform speed, and at the same time advanced axially by a lead screw mechanism. During rotation a very fine beam of light passes through the transparent film and impinges on a sensitive photo-electric cell, which is mounted inside the cylinder. The intensity of the light impinging on the cell varies in accordance with the density of the film and corresponding variations of current are produced in the cell. These variations are employed to modulate a ""carrier"" current having a frequency of 1,300 cycles per second. The carrier current is transmitted over the line and at the receiving end its varying amplitudes control a light valve (a sensitive shutter device), which determines the amount of light impinging on a sensitised film attached to a cylinder similar to that employed at the transmitting end and rotating in synchronism with it. In this way the light and shade of the original picture are reproduced, but the received picture will be a negative instead of a positive. The motion of the cylinders at the two ends is synchronized by means of tuning forks controlling a 400-cycle synchronizing current, which is transmitted over the same circuit as the picture currents, the separation of the two currents being effected by means of electric wave filters.",,,"[{'name': 'The International Western Electric Company', 'role': 'Presented by'}, {'name': 'The International Western Electric Company', 'role': 'Maker'}, {'name': 'American Telephone and Telegraph Co.', 'role': 'Developer'}, {'name': 'Western Electric Co.', 'role': 'Developer'}]",,,thermionic tube;photo-electric cell;transparent film;transparent cylinder;lead screw mechanism;light valve;sensitised film;tuning forks;electric wave filters,"1,300 cycles per second;400-cycle","An examination of these telephotographs will show the degree of technical excellence to which the transmission of pictures over long telephone lines has now been carried.
