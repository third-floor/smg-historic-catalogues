These skips carry about 2 tons of ore, and are made of strong sheet-iron. They run on four flanged wheels, of which the two in front are half the thickness of those at the rear. A special guide rail is provided at the top of the furnace, placed so that the narrower front wheels, when descending, pass by it, while the broader hind wheels mount upon the guide, with the result that the back of the skip is lifted up and the charge in the skip is shot into the upper hopper, provided with a small cup and cone. When sufficient material has accumulated in this hopper, the weight of the charge causes the cone to fall, allowing the charge to fall into a gas chamber, which in its turn is also provided with cup and cone discharge of normal dimensions, fitted with a balance weight. A further accumulation of charge in this chamber causes the balance weight to rise, allowing the charge to fall into the furnace. By this means an even distribution of charge in the furnace is obtained, while the loss of gas is reduced to a minimum.

With the progression of time, the art of beating thinner gold has been discovered, and yet thinner gold leaf is produced, but the process as used to-day differs but little from that employed by the ancient Egyptians. The process requires very little machinery, and that only in the initial stages, the greater part of this process requiring only the skilful use of a hand hammer. The process consists essentially of the following stages:\u2014 The fine gold is alloyed with a proportion of copper and silver, to give the desired colour and quality of leaf. This alloy is melted and cast into a bar, which is gradually reduced by rolling, with frequent annealing, to a \u201cribbon,\u201d 1\u215b in. wide, and 2 yards in length to the ounce. This ribbon is then cut into square pieces, each piece weighing 6 grains, and placed between the leaves of a \u201ccutch\u201d (consisting of 200 sheets of parchment prepared from animal matter), measuring 4 in. square. The \u201ccutch\u201d is bound with parchment bands and beaten for about 30 min. with a 20-lb. hammer, until each square of gold ribbon has become as large as the \u201ccutch.\u201d The leaves of gold are now removed from the sheets of parchment paper, quartered with a \u201cskewing\u201d knife, and the quarters placed between the skins of a \u201cshoder\u201d (containing 800 rather coarse strong skins of 4\u00bd in. square). The \u201cshoder\u201d requires 2 hrs. careful beating; for this purpose a 12-lb. hammer is used, and the beating is continued until the quarter leaves have spread to the edges of the skins. They are again cut into quarters, this time with a sharpened reed, and the quarters placed between the skins of a \u201cmould\u201d (composed of 1,000 very thin sheets of gold-beaters\u2019 skin, 5\u215b in. square; these 1,000 skins measure less than 1 in. in thickness and weigh but a few ounces). The \u201cmould\u201d requires some 5 hrs. beating with an 8-lb. hammer. It is in this final beating that the quality of the finished leaf is determined, and the greatest skill on the part of the beater is required. The beating is done on solid blocks of marble, some of which are centuries old, handed down from generation to generation of gold-beaters. Here and there there are the deep holes formed in the marble by the mere pressure of the thumb of the worker as he holds down the mould. When the leaves are beaten to the required size and thinness, they are removed from the skins, placed singly on a calf-skin cushion and trimmed to size with sharpened reeds fixed in a small frame called a \u201cwaggon,\u201d and afterwards placed between the sheets of thin paper books. From the \u201cribbon\u201d stage until the finished leaves are in books the gold is never touched by the hand, but manipulated with boxwood pincers. To illustrate the malleability of gold, it may be stated that 12 dwts. will produce 2,500 leaves. Were it possible to beat 1 oz. into a single sheet, it would measure about 250 sq. ft.
