Object name: MODEL OF A HORSE GEAR AND CRUSHING ROLL.
Maker/Donor: Watt Collection.
Date of creation: 1876.
Object entry information: This horse gear is in the form of a horizontal lever turning on a vertical axis. A projecting stud on the upper side of the lever forms a crank-pin from which a connecting rod is carried to a swinging lever. From this lever two links proceed to the axle of a vertical edge runner, which can be rolled in the fixed trough. The trough has a grid bottom through which the crushed material escapes when sufficiently reduced.

Object name: MODEL OF HORSE GEAR. (Scale 1: 8.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. J. L. Larkworthy & Co.
Date of creation: 1891.
Object entry information: This shows a very general form of machine for applying the power of a horse to the driving of light machinery, such as chaff-cutters, small pumps, etc.; but although larger gears are made to transmit the power of two or four horses, they are not much used in this country when the power required approaches that of a small steam engine.
The machine has a pole attached to the vertical axis of a bevel wheel of 103 teeth, gearing into a bevel pinion of 12 teeth, whose rotation is transmitted by a shaft coupled by universal joints to multiplying spur gear placed outside the circular horse track. The multiplying gear consists of a spur wheel of 76 teeth driving a pinion of 17 teeth, to the shaft of which a pulley is attached for further transmitting the power by belting. The horse in going once round the track causes the pulley to make 38.3 rev., and when walking at 2.5 miles per hour in a path 25 ft. in diam., drives the pulley at 108 rev. per min.

Object name: HORSE GEAR.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. J. Crowley & Co.
Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This is a small and compact form of gear patented in 1879 and intended for use with a pony. The slow speed of the vertical shaft turned by the animal is multiplied 30.2 times so as to give higher speed to the horizontal shaft from which machinery is to be driven. To the bracket that holds the pole is attached a short horizontal shaft, carrying a bevel wheel of 31 teeth and a bevel pinion of 22 teeth. The pinion gears into a horizontal bevel ring that forms part of the framing, and a bevel pinion of 16 teeth on the high-speed shaft. The bevel wheel gears with a bevel pinion of 22 teeth on a vertical axis in the centre, and this pinion carries gears with a pinion of 16 teeth on the high-speed shaft. The motion is transmitted through two Hooke's joints to the external driving pulley, a pawl gear preventing accidental rotation in the wrong direction.

Object entry information: A wooden platform, constructed as an endless belt, is supported on rollers, and at each extremity passes round a polygonal pulley. It is inclined at an angle of 13 deg., giving a rise of 1 in 4.5. The horse stands on the sloping platform, which is set in motion by the component of the horse's weight acting parallel to the platform, less the frictional losses, which are considerable. The horse's head is haltered to a bar in front, so that he is compelled to walk as the platform recedes.

The pinion gears into a horizontal bevel ring that forms part of the framing, and a bevel pinion of 16 teeth on the high-speed shaft. The bevel wheel gears with a bevel pinion of 22 teeth on a vertical axis in the centre, and this pinion carries gears with a pinion of 16 teeth on the high-speed shaft. The motion is transmitted through two Hooke's joints to the external driving pulley, a pawl gear preventing accidental rotation in the wrong direction.

A projecting stud on the upper side of the lever forms a crank-pin from which a connecting rod is carried to a swinging lever. From this lever two links proceed to the axle of a vertical edge runner, which can be rolled in the fixed trough. The trough has a grid bottom through which the crushed material escapes when sufficiently reduced.

Object entry information: This shows a very general form of machine for applying the power of a horse to the driving of light machinery, such as chaff-cutters, small pumps, etc.; but although larger gears are made to transmit the power of two or four horses, they are not much used in this country when the power required approaches that of a small steam engine.
The machine has a pole attached to the vertical axis of a bevel wheel of 103 teeth, gearing into a bevel pinion of 12 teeth, whose rotation is transmitted by a shaft coupled by universal joints to multiplying spur gear placed outside the circular horse track. The multiplying gear consists of a spur wheel of 76 teeth driving a pinion of 17 teeth, to the shaft of which a pulley is attached for further transmitting the power by belting. The horse in going once round the track causes the pulley to make 38.3 rev., and when walking at 2.5 miles per hour in a path 25 ft. in diam., drives the pulley at 108 rev. per min.

Maker/Donor: Messrs. T. McKenzie & Sons (Lent)
Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This form of self-regulating windmill was introduced by Mr. D. Halliday in 1877. The vanes are arranged radially in six groups forming sectors of the complete disc. The sectors are pivoted at the middle on axes forming chords of a circle, and levers on them are connected with a sliding sleeve on the axle, which is in turn connected with a weighted lever normally holding the vanes parallel with the wind. The angle of the sectors is adjusted by means of a lever and a rope passing over a pulley and attached to the weighted lever. The mill is directed by a tail, and is mounted on a tower. In the model it drives a pump, at the ground level, from a crank on the axle, but the machine is also used for driving light machinery by gearing and shafting.

Object entry information: shaft, and probably provided as an alternative source of power. The cap of the mill is carried on friction wheels, and is automatically slewed by a small bevel gear which works with a worm that gears into a ring of large arms. The regulating arrangement of this mill was patented in 1789 by Stephen Hooper, of Margate, and forms an early instance of the application of the centrifugal governor. Each sail is made up of small elements wound on separate rollers. These elements yield as the velocity of the windmill increases, centrifugal action causes these elements to be rolled up against the pull of a weighted spiral drum or fusee within the mill. Hooper also described a conical pendulum governor which, when the speed increased, would move a weighted lever connected with the friction wheels, and so stop the action of the mill. The sectional elevation, dated 1804, shows the construction of a four-armed windmill driving a sugar-cane mill, probably for squeezing the juice from sugar-cane. The cap of the mill is carried on friction wheels, and is turned by a large hand-wheel provided with a worm that gears into a spur ring secured to the top of the tower; by these means the mill can be adjusted as the direction of the wind alters.

Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: In this windmill, patented by Mr. F. Warner in 1868, the vanes yield as the pressure of the wind increases, and thus automatically adjust themselves to suit its force. The mill has 24 radial vanes, mounted between two rings, and each pivoted about its front edge so that the angle which it presents to the wind may vary. The ends of the pivots are connected with another ring which is attached to a rod running through the centre of the axle, and connected with a balance weight which keeps adjusting the vanes to such an angle as to make the resultant pressure on them constant. A tail is provided for setting the wheel of vanes in a direction parallel to the wind. The mill is mounted on a wooden tower and is arranged to drive a small pump from an eccentric on the axle. It is stopped by turning the vanes edgeways to the wind by means of a rod attached to the weighted lever.

Maker/Donor: Made by MM. Regnard Frères.
Date of creation: 1891.
Object entry information: Smeaton improved the undershot wheel, but it was Gen. J. V. Poncelet who, in 1824, brought it to the high state of efficiency illustrated by the model. The characteristic features of his design are the backwardly curved floats and the absence of a sole plate. The water is projected on to the wheel buckets tangentially, at the periphery, through a sluice inclined at an angle varying between 40° and 60° to the horizontal, according to the diameter of the wheel and to the effective head of water. The sluice gate is operated by a hand-wheel, spur gear and rack. The buckets are proportioned so that the water enters without shock, with the velocity due to the head, and flows up the vanes, until brought to rest by gravity, when it falls, exerting downward pressure. The water is discharged from the floats with but little remaining forward velocity. In wheels of this type, however the power produced by the weight of the water is negligible compared with that due to its momentum. The floats are inclined on the upstream side about 30°, and the radius of the bucket is usually one-eighth the diameter of the wheel. Owing to its slow speed and cumbersome gearing the Poncelet wheel has been displaced by the low-fall turbine. The effective head of water should not exceed 5.5 ft. ; the maximum efficiency is 65 per cent.

Maker/Donor: Lent by the Sandycroft Foundry and Engine Works Co.,
Date of creation: 1890
Object entry information: This is a form of impulse turbine much used in mining districts and other situations in which a considerable head is available, as its high speed and great power render it a most convenient motor, while its extreme simplicity minimises the risk of failure. The early form of the machine consisted of a wheel having radial floats or paddles projecting from the upon which a rapid stream of water was directed by a shoot; reversal or stop of water in such cases were both effected by moving the shoot—the supply generally far exceeding the power required. Wheels with concave vanes were in use before the year 1737, and Poncelet in 1827 proved their superiority over those with flat vanes, but it was considerably later that in the mining districts of California the practical development of this important form of turbine was chiefly effected. The original “ miner’s wheels ” there employed were shrouded and had vanes made as triangular prisms; they had an efficiency of about 40 per cent., but were subsequently improved by the adoption of cup-shaped vanes. In 1874, however, Mr. J. Moore improved these vanes by forming them with a central wedge-shaped ridge which split the jet, while in 1878 Mr. L. A. Pelton independently arrived at this double construction of cup, and to him the commercial introduction and development of the Pelton wheel is chiefly due. The model has a central wheel of cast iron, to the rim of which are secured twenty-eight double buckets of gunmetal 2.3 in. wide, the over-all diameter of the revolving parts being 20 in. The shaft is carried in three bearings, near the central one of which a screen or partition would be fitted to prevent water splashing upon the belt pulley by which the power obtained is transmitted. The supply water, which is usually brought through light pipes of sheet steel is, after passing through a sluice valve, led by a conical pipe to a removable discharge nozzle, so that by changing the nozzle the load on the wheel may be altered without seriously reducing the efficiency of the motor. Each bucket or cup consists of two semi-cylindrical portions, uniting in a central ridge which divides the entering water jet, so that each half slides round the inside of its cup and has its motion reversed before escaping at the opposite edge* by running the wheel at a circumferential speed slightly less than half the velocity with which the water issues from the nozzle; the whole of the energy being completely transferred from the cups, dead water is discharged from the wheel. To facilitate the escape of the dead water from the wheel, the buckets are given a forward inclination; the wheel must in all cases be above the level of the tail race.

Object entry information: This is a small example of the impulse turbine known as the Pelton wheel. It is supplied with pressure water from the domestic mains or hydraulic supply, and it is enclosed in a watertight casing to render it suitable for driving small machinery within a building. The used water is led away by a pipe from the bottom of the case. The wheel runner is a cast-iron disc to which are riveted twenty Pelton buckets of bronze, which are given a backward rake to facilitate the discharge of the used water. The water is delivered as a horizontal jet, while the wheel while water falling on the opposite side is fixed a baffle plate to prevent the used water falling on the wheel and thereby absorbing power. The power developed by the motor is varied by interchanging the nozzles, of which there are three sizes, or by the removal of a box nut, or a needle regulating nozzle could be substituted. The stop valve should remain fully open under all circumstances. The wheel shaft is carried in bearings bolted to the casing, and is fitted with a pulley for belt transmission of the power given off. To facilitate examination of the wheel one side of the case is made removable.

Maker/Donor: Presented by P. Pitman, Esq.
Date of creation: 1903.
Object entry information: When speed requirements call for a wheel of small diameter in which it is not possible to obtain sufficient power with one nozzle, two or more nozzles may be used. The jets of water are caused to impinge on the same wheel without conflict so that there is no appreciable loss of efficiency. To obtain high efficiency when there is a fluctuating supply of water, one, or two nozzles only may be employed at a time.
The photograph shows a wheel with three nozzles made in 1902 for driving mining machinery; a feature is the low head of water under which the wheel is operating. The runner is of steel plate secured to the shaft by a cast-iron coupling. The buckets of bronze, 16 in number, are bolted to the rim, their interior surfaces being ground and polished to minimize friction losses. The supply pipe, 24 in. diam., terminates in a chamber to which are bolted three curved pipes, each fitted with a bronze nozzle independently controlled by a gate valve. The shaft runs in ring-oiled bearings mounted on cast-iron A-frames bolted to the bedplate, and to the steel plate splash housing. The power is taken off by a belt. The wheel is 5 ft. pitch diam., and under a head of 60 ft. develops 50 brake h.p. at a speed of 135 r.p.m. The efficiency varied from 75 to 80 per cent. according as one, two or three nozzles were used.
In modern practice not more than two nozzles are employed on one wheel; if more power is required two runners are mounted on the same shaft.

Maker/Donor: Made by Peter Koch.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: This represents a tangential impulse turbine or Pelton wheel, made by Messrs. Amme, Giessccke & Konegen, of Brunswick, and embodying features patented by Messrs. V. Gelpke & P. Kugel in 1905 and 1911. Its speed is controlled, under varying load, by a servomotor nozzle regulator actuated by a centrifugal governor, while an automatic relief valve, which comes into action when the nozzles are closed rapidly, prevents a dangerous rise of pressure in the pipe line.
The turbine has a single disc wheel with 16 buckets bolted to its edge, the effective diameter being 24.6 in. ; this is keyed on a shaft supported by ring-oiled bearings which are bolted to the sides of the casing enclosing the wheel. Two variable nozzles are mounted in the casing, at right angles to one another, and the supply pipe has a branch leading to each. Each nozzle consists of a cylindrical casing, to the inner end of which is fitted a sliding convergent tip. At the centre of the nozzle is fixed a spear-shaped rod or needle, the point of which projects through the tip, thus constituting an annular channel through which the water issues ; the needle is so shaped that the water beyond its point forms a solid cylindrical jet. The buckets are ellipsoidal in shape, and are notched at the outer edge, so that they do not cut into the jet until they reach their effective position. The sliding nozzle tips are connected, by links, levers and connecting-rods, with the main piston of the servomotor speed regulator; an oil pressure of 220 lb. per sq. in. acts on one side of this, and opposes the water pressure which acts on the nozzles and tends to keep them fully open. The movements of the servomotor piston are controlled by a piston valve which allows oil to enter or leave the cylinder ; this valve is attached to a centrifugal governor, and it works inside a perforated sleeve connected with the piston, by a roller and incline. As the piston moves, the sleeve moves also and counteracts the movement of the governor valve, thus closing the oil passages, and causing the piston, and with it the nozzles, to take up a definite position corresponding with the position of the governor valve.
The pressure relief valve is fitted to the inlet pipe, and it consists of a sluice valve attached to a trunk piston fitted within an oil cylinder. At the centre of the piston is a long hollow rod which serves as a valve to distribute pressure oil to either end of the cylinder, the oil being led through the rod from an upper reservoir. The rod carries a piston fitting easily within another oil-filled cylinder, which is connected with the servomotor in such a manner that it is positively lifted when the nozzles are closed, but is not affected when they are

Maker/Donor: Received 1915.
Date of creation: 1767
Object entry information: This engraving, taken from Ferguson’s “Mechanics,” 1767, shows a corn mill driven by a reaction turbine of the form proposed by Dr. Barker and put into practice by Dr. J. T. Desaguliers about 1743. A similar arrangement had been used by Hero in his steam turbine or aeolipile about A.D. 50 (see No. 35). The machine consisted of a vertical wooden frame supporting a platform at the top, on which rested the lower and stationary millstone. The upper and movable millstone was attached, passed down through the middle of the frame, and its lower end fitted in a footstep bearing, mounted on a pivoted beam extending across the bottom of the frame. A wide tube surrounded and was fixed to the shaft, and its upper end was furnished with a funnel mouth into which the water was delivered from a supply pipe. The lower end of the tube terminated in two straight, horizontal arms, closed at the ends and each provided with a small orifice, through which the water issued in tangential jets which by their reaction caused the tube and shaft to rotate. The free end of the lower bearing lever was suspended by a long bolt from a bracket on the frame, a nut on the bolt serving to adjust the upper millstone. The mill in this simple form was only made in small sizes, as it entailed a central tube equal in length to the head of water available, and the mass of water in the tube and arms was carried round as useless dead weight. This defect was overcome by M. Mathon de la Cour, who, in 1775, proposed to deliver the water directly to the arms of the mill from the upturned end of a fixed pipe, but this improvement was not put in practice until James Whitelaw used it in 1839 (see No. 21). The hydraulic efficiency of the simple Barker’s mill is about 66 per cent. and the brake efficiency 60 per cent., this being attained when the linear speed of the orifices is about equal to the velocity of the water due to its head.

Object entry information: The photograph shows an improved form of bucket, applicable to impulse water-wheels of the Pelton type, in which the dividing wedge or ""splitter"" is curved in a radial direction with a view of prolonging the time of effective action, i.e., when the bucket is in the best position with its face at right angles to the impinging jet. The buckets shown were fitted to a turbine consisting of two wheels of 4.75 ft. diam., working under a head of 1,010 ft., running at a speed of 450 r.p.m., and developing 1,540 brake h.p. In the adjacent drawing, the plan shows the general lay-out of the bucket, and the sections on lines C D and A B the geometrical construction. (See ""Engineering,"" CIX, 851.)

Maker/Donor: Received 1915.
Date of creation: 1767
Object entry information: This engraving, taken from Ferguson’s “Mechanics,” 1767, shows a corn mill driven by a reaction turbine of the form proposed by Dr. Barker and put into practice by Dr. J. T. Desaguliers about 1743. A similar arrangement had been used by Hero in his steam turbine or aeolipile about A.D. 50 (see No. 35). The machine consisted of a vertical wooden frame supporting a platform at the top, on which rested the lower and stationary millstone. The upper and movable millstone was attached, passed down through the middle of the frame, and its lower end fitted in a footstep bearing, mounted on a pivoted beam extending across the bottom of the frame. A wide tube surrounded and was fixed to the shaft, and its upper end was furnished with a funnel mouth into which the water was delivered from a supply pipe. The lower end of the tube terminated in two straight, horizontal arms, closed at the ends and each provided with a small orifice, through which the water issued in tangential jets which by their reaction caused the tube and shaft to rotate. The free end of the lower bearing lever was suspended by a long bolt from a bracket on the frame, a nut on the bolt serving to adjust the upper millstone. The mill in this simple form was only made in small sizes, as it entailed a central tube equal in length to the head of water available, and the mass of water in the tube and arms was carried round as useless dead weight. This defect was overcome by M. Mathon de la Cour, who, in 1775, proposed to deliver the water directly to the arms of the mill from the upturned end of a fixed pipe, but this improvement was not put in practice until James Whitelaw used it in 1839 (see No. 21). The hydraulic efficiency of the simple Barker’s mill is about 66 per cent. and the brake efficiency 60 per cent., this being attained when the linear speed of the orifices is about equal to the velocity of the water due to its head.

Object name: MODEL OF FOURNEYRON’S TURBINE.
Maker/Donor: Made by T. B. Jordan, Esq.,
Date of creation: 1842.
Object entry information: This represents the radial outward flow turbine as constructed by Benoit Fourneyron, who completed his first machine in 1827, after having spent four years in experimenting.
The machine consists of a vertical cylindrical chamber with a side inlet for the water, and a central pipe below through which the water passes to an annular outlet at the base of the pipe. This outlet is fitted with thirty guide blades which direct the water in a tangential course as it escapes. Surrounding this passage is a runner, keyed to a vertical shaft, and provided with vanes between which the water flows as it passes from the inner to the outer circumference, where it is finally discharged.

The water under pressure is discharged in a tangential direction from the fixed guides, and on passing between the vanes of the enclosing wheel has its direction of motion gradually changed until the energy of the water had been transferred to the wheel, when the water is discharged at the outer rims, dead.
The central pipe containing the guides is carried by three screwed rods connected above by gearing, by which the pipe can be accurately raised, so as to contract the supply passage into the wheel if less than full power is required. The toe of the shaft is carried in a special bearing, supplied with oil under pressure. The power given off by the shaft is transmitted by bevel gear at the upper end.
To a scale of 1: 2, the model represents generally a turbine erected by Fourneyron in 1837, at St. Blazien, Baden. The runner was 22 in. diam. and under the head of 354 ft. developed a speed of 2,300 rev. per min.; the efficiency was stated to be 80 per cent.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messer. G. Gilkes & Co.,
Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This is a working model of an inward-flow turbine of the type patented in 1850 by Prof. James Thomson, the result of whose investigations of the laws of the free vortex have been applied in the design.
It consists of a large casing, into which the water enters and from which it escapes axially by two discharge pipes. Pivoted in the casing are blades or vanes, which give a spiral direction to the water as it approaches and impinges upon the curved vanes of the runner to which it imparts rotation. Each vane has a short shaft and lever connected with external brick work by which adjustment of the orifices can be made simultaneously. The advantage of this method of regulation, known as the wicket gate, is that there is little loss of efficiency when working at partial loads.
This turbine would use 600 cub. ft. of water per min. with a fall of 25.5 ft., and would give about 22.4 h.p. at 75 per cent. efficiency; it would make about 250 rev. per min. If the model itself is worked with water it will make about 560 rev. per min.

Object entry information: The feature of the machine is the use of spiral arms, while the water enters the centre of the turbine from the upturned end of a fixed pipe. By these means the frictional and eddy losses are reduced and the efficiency is increased somewhat over that of the simple Barker’s mill.

The small turbine shown consists of two cast iron discs, 2 in. apart, the lower one having a central orifice fitted to the end of the supply pipe so as to rotate without leakage. The inner faces of the discs have spiral grooves formed in them, to which are fitted sheet iron plates forming the sides of the two spiral passages through which the water issues. These passages are of constant depth, but decrease in width from the centre to the outer edge, where they terminate in tangential orifices 0.5 in. wide. The two discs are clamped together by four through bolts. The vertical driving shaft is fixed to the upper disc and its end carries a bevel pinion gearing with a bevel wheel on a horizontal shaft which transmits the power to the machinery to be driven, the speed reduction being 50 to 13. The diameter of the orifice centres is 14 in., and the supply pipe, 3.5 in. diam., is fitted with a sluice valve. The turbine worked with a head of 15 ft., and was in use in North Wales for 35 years before it was acquired for this Museum.

Turbines of this kind were made over 9 ft. diam. and developing about 100 h.p., but larger machines were usually fitted with self-regulating variable orifices. The maximum hydraulic efficiency was about 75 per cent.

The diagram shows two of the turbines and their dynamos in the first portion of the scheme of one of the supply companies—The Niagara Falls Power Co.—which began work in 1890 and first delivered current in 1895. The water is conveyed by an intake canal, 250 ft. wide, 1,700 ft. long, and 12 ft. deep, to the power house, where there is a wheel slot for the turbines, 17 ft. deep and the same in length, cut in the solid rock. A tail-race tunnel, 21 ft. high by 19 ft. wide, conveys the dead water to the river below the falls. The available fall is 136 ft. and the penstocks are 7.5 ft. diam. The turbines, 10 in number and each of 5,000 h.p., are of the twin outward flow type designed in Switzerland and made in the United States. A governor and a ratchet relay acting on a cylindrical sleeve on the outside of the wheel regulates the supply. The water pressure acts on the cover of the upper turbine, but is relieved from acting on the lower turbine, thus giving an upward pressure counterbalancing the weight of the shaft and the attachments amounting to about 70 tons. The dynamo is at the top of the shaft running at 250 rev. per min., giving a voltage of 2,200 with a frequency of 25 periods per second. The plant has been remodelled and largely extended recently.

For starting, the pressure fluid can be admitted directly to the motor cylinder by means of a four-way cock fitted to the supply pipes.
The governor may be worked with either water or oil at a pressure of about 150 lb. per sq. in.; when using oil it is usually mounted on a self-contained tank bed fitted with the pressure pumps, etc. (see No. 18).

Object entry information: This is a small portable machine for rotating the tools used in drilling, tapping, tube expanding, etc., by the application of mechanical power, so as to reduce the time otherwise necessary in performing such work by hand labour alone.
The sectional example shown is a piston motor, patented in 1896 by Mr. H. J. Kimmans, in which there are four fixed single-acting cylinders arranged in pairs in two planes at right angles, and driving a two-throw crankshaft having cranks at 180 deg. Two pistons are connected with each crankpin, so that a fairly uniform turning effort shall be maintained. To reduce the bulk of the machine, the connecting-rod ends are in the form of hinged clips embracing their crankpin, one being forked and bearing outside the other; the ends also embrace the rods, to which they are secured by screwed sleeves. Each pair of cylinders is provided with a hollow piston valve, sliding in a bush and driven by an eccentric; the valve admits air to each cylinder alternately, through suitable ports in the casing and bush, which allow exhaust takes place along the axis of the valve.
The cylinders and crankshaft are enclosed in a casing which forms an air chamber, and is provided with a cover through which passes a screwed sleeve with a star handle, for feeding the drill. The tool holder runs on a ball thrust bearing, and has a conical socket for drills and an externally screwed boss; it is driven from the crankshaft by spur gearing which reduces the speed in the ratio of 1: 7.
The cylinders are 2 in. diam., 2 in. stroke, and the brake h.p. exerted is 1.5, with a consumption of 35 cub. ft. of free air per min. The air pressure used is from 70 to 100 lb. per sq. in., and the maximum duty of the machine is to drill, in metal, holes of 2 in. diam. The weight of the motor complete is 35 lb.

Object entry information: This is a water-pressure engine designed for working the bellows supplying air to an organ, but the cylinder in its action resembles the steam cylinder of a direct-acting steam pump. The supply of water is controlled by a valve connected with the air reservoir, so that the speed of working is automatically adjusted to the consumption of wind.
The blower shown has a cylinder 5.5 in. diam. by 10 in. stroke, and is fitted with a valve gear patented by Mr. D. Joy in 1874. The piston-rod is directly attached to the bellows, but has on it a tappet which reverses the distributing slide valve on the completion of each stroke. This slide valve is of the piston type, but is in reality two valves combined in one, for by its sliding motion the valve acts as the main slide valve, while by a rotary motion through 20 deg. it acts as a plug valve. The plug is in the middle of the length of the piston slide, and by its motion lets the water to and from the ends of the chest of the piston valve, so causing the sliding motion of this valve.

Object entry information: the piston valve, and its lower end is connected with an eccentric fixed on a shaft that is partially rotated by the movement of the motor piston. Ports are formed in the valve casing and admit pressure of which the pressure fluid is distributed to either end of the servomotor cylinder. When the speed increases the governor lifts the piston valve and admits pressure to one end of the servomotor, while the other end is open to the exhaust. The motion of the piston then raises the compensating sleeve which closes the ports; the piston is thus caused to take up a definite position corresponding with the position of the governor valve, and hunting is prevented. The valve sleeve is coupled by rolling levers with the oil brake cylinder, which is fitted with a check valve so adjusted that, however sudden the change of load, the action of the governor is not interfered with by the back action of the sleeve.

Date of creation: 1914.
Object entry information: This is an example of the hydraulic engine for organ blowing, the valve gear of which was patented by Mr. H. Bamford in 1885. The piston-rod is connected directly with the bellows, and water is admitted to either end of the working cylinder by a piston valve. This valve is itself moved by the pressure water which is distributed by a small auxiliary slide valve driven from the piston-rod by a tappet-gear.
The engine has a horizontal working cylinder, with the valve chest on top. The main valve consists of four pistons, connected together and sliding in a cylindrical casing which is provided with suitable inlet and exhaust ports. The two inner pistons serve to distribute the pressure water to the end of the working cylinder, the space between them being in communication with the water inlet, while the two outer pistons are packed with cup leathers and work in the closed ends of the casing. These ends serve as cylinders, to which the pressure water is admitted alternately by the auxiliary valve, through ports in the main valve stem, so as to cause the piston valve to move from end to end. The valve stem between the two inner pistons is of rectangular section, and the necessary slide valve is applied to its upper face. Three ports are formed in this face, the outer ports leading to the ends of the main valve and the central one to the exhaust, while side lugs are formed on the auxiliary valve to keep it in place, and to serve as abutments against which the arms of a forked lever bear when moving the valve. This lever is mounted on a shaft which passes through a stuffing-box and has on its outer end a slotted lever connected with a rod which is worked backwards and forwards, through a short distance at each end of the piston stroke, by a tappet-rod fixed to an arm on the piston-rod. The tappets are adjustable so that the valve may be set to reverse the motion without shock.
When the piston nears the end of its stroke, the tappet-gear carries the auxiliary valve in the same direction, thus admitting the pressure water to the opposite end of the piston valve, and driving it in the same direction so as to admit water behind the piston to drive it back. A sectioned valve chest is shown beside the engine.

Object entry information: This is a small example of de Haag's high-pressure water motor, for pressures up to 300 lb. per sq. in. These motors are frequently used in mine workings, the water for driving being obtained from the delivery pipe of the main pumping engine, and the motor discharging its exhaust water into the mine sump.
The cylinder of the engine oscillates on two hollow trunnions, closed at the outer ends, the hollow spaces within each trunnion being divided into two compartments, one of which on each side communicates with either end of the cylinder. Two slots cut longitudinally in the trunnion serve for ports for admission and exhaust of the water, one giving admission to each end of the cylinder, and the lower part of each bearing there are three ports, a wide one in the middle communicating with the supply pipe, and a narrower one on each side of this leading to the exhaust pipe. The oscillation of the cylinder causes those ports in the trunnions to slide over those in the bearings, so opening up each end of the cylinder to exhaust or pressure alternately, just as in the case of an ordinary slide valve. The supply and exhaust pipes are each fitted with an air vessel to prevent shocks in the pipes.
This motor has a cylinder 2.5 in. diam. by 4 in. stroke, and when making 100 r.p.m. under a pressure of 150 lb. gives off 1 brake h.p. Larger sizes are made up to those having 9 in. cylinders, which, running at 50 r.p.m. exert 24 brake h.p. under 150 lb. pressure.

A simple tappet moving a single slide valve will not work at a very slow speed without assistance, and it is for this reason that some form of auxiliary valve is almost invariably introduced. A sectional drawing (scale 1: 12) further illustrates the construction.

Object name: BAMFORD HYDRAULIC ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Presented by S. J. Ambler, Esq.
Date of creation: 1914.
Object entry information: This is an example of the hydraulic engine for organ blowing, the valve gear of which was patented by Mr. H. Bamford in 1885. The piston-rod is connected directly with the bellows, and water is admitted to either end of the working cylinder by a piston valve. This valve is itself moved by the pressure water which is distributed by a small auxiliary slide valve driven from the piston-rod by a tappet-gear.
The engine has a horizontal working cylinder, with the valve chest on top. The main valve consists of four pistons, connected together and sliding in a cylindrical casing which is provided with suitable inlet and exhaust ports. The two inner pistons serve to distribute the pressure water to the end of the working cylinder, the space between them being in communication with the water inlet, while the two outer pistons are packed with cup leathers and work in the closed ends of the casing. These ends serve as cylinders, to which the pressure water is admitted alternately by the auxiliary valve, through ports in the main valve stem, so as to cause the piston valve to move from end to end. The valve stem between the two inner pistons is of rectangular section, and the necessary slide valve is applied to its upper face. Three ports are formed in this face, the outer ports leading to the ends of the main valve and the central one to the exhaust, while side lugs are formed on the auxiliary valve to keep it in place, and to serve as abutments against which the arms of a forked lever bear when moving the valve. This lever is mounted on a shaft which passes through a stuffing-box and has on its outer end a slotted lever connected with a rod which is worked backwards and forwards, through a short distance at each end of the piston stroke, by a tappet-rod fixed to an arm on the piston-rod. The tappets are adjustable so that the valve may be set to reverse the motion without shock.
When the piston nears the end of its stroke, the tappet-gear carries the auxiliary valve in the same direction, thus admitting the pressure water to the opposite end of the piston valve, and driving it in the same direction so as to admit water behind the piston to drive it back. A sectioned valve chest is shown beside the engine.

Object name: WATER MOTOR WITH OSCILLATING CYLINDER (working).
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. W. H. Bailey & Co.
Date of creation: 1894.
Object entry information: This is a small example of de Haag's high-pressure water motor, for pressures up to 300 lb. per sq. in. These motors are frequently used in mine workings, the water for driving being obtained from the delivery pipe of the main pumping engine, and the motor discharging its exhaust water into the mine sump.
The cylinder of the engine oscillates on two hollow trunnions, closed at the outer ends, the hollow spaces within each trunnion being divided into two compartments, one of which on each side communicates with either end of the cylinder. Two slots cut longitudinally in the trunnion serve for ports for admission and exhaust of the water, one giving admission to each end of the cylinder, and the lower part of each bearing there are three ports, a wide one in the middle communicating with the supply pipe, and a narrower one on each side of this leading to the exhaust pipe. The oscillation of the cylinder causes those ports in the trunnions to slide over those in the bearings, so opening up each end of the cylinder to exhaust or pressure alternately, just as in the case of an ordinary slide valve. The supply and exhaust pipes are each fitted with an air vessel to prevent shocks in the pipes.
This motor has a cylinder 2.5 in. diam. by 4 in. stroke, and when making 100 r.p.m. under a pressure of 150 lb. gives off 1 brake h.p. Larger sizes are made up to those having 9 in. cylinders, which, running at 50 r.p.m. exert 24 brake h.p. under 150 lb. pressure.

Object name: HYDRAULIC SWASH-PLATE ENGINE (working).
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1910. Received 1914.
Object entry information: This is a type of engine in which a shaft, having an oblique disc or swash-plate fixed to it, is caused to rotate by the successive pressures upon the disc of a number of pistons, working in cylinders arranged in a circle, with their axes parallel with the shaft. Such an engine may have a large number of cylinders compactly arranged and gives a very uniform torque. The small example shown has 16 cylinders bored horizontally in a single casting; the pistons are packed with cup leathers and bear against the rounded ends of the piston-rods. The outer ends of the rods are ball-shaped and are held in a circular ring which bears against the swash-plate, ball bearings being interposed to reduce the friction. The ring is controlled by two diametrically opposite pins which slide in horizontal slots attached to the bed-plate of the engine. The end thrust is taken by a row of balls placed between the back of the swash-plate and a fixed disc which is surrounded by an outer casing formed in one with the driving shaft. The valve gear is of the simplified form patented by Mr. F. G. D. Johnston and Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. in 1908. A single rotary valve is used, placed behind the cylinders and having five inlet and five exhaust ports disposed in a circle; the valve seat has 16 cylinder ports symmetrically arranged, and these are connected with the cylinders in a particular order. This arrangement besides reducing the number of ports in the valve, and therefore its size, also requires that the valve shall rotate at only one-fifth of the speed of the main valve.

On the end of the intermittently rotated shaft is a sprocket wheel, and on the shaft to be continuously rotated, which is in line with it, is another sprocket wheel; over the two wheels hangs an endless chain, in the loops of which are two weighted sheaves, one of which is much the heavier, the difference being the driving weight. When the tidal motion is rapid the excess power is stored by lifting the weight, while, when the tidal movement stops, this weight gives off its stored energy in descending, and so keeps the driving shaft in motion. The weighted sheaves are connected by a hanging chain which prevents the inequalities in the effort which would otherwise arise from the varying length of chain on the driving side.

The machine is erected over a tank or well to which the tide has access; into this hangs a weight and also a float, connected by a chain that passes over a sprocket wheel on the overhead shaft, then round a loose wheel on the framing and back over another sprocket wheel. These wheels are connected with the shaft by ratchet and pawl mechanism, which causes both upward and downward movements of the float chain to rotate the shaft, always in one direction. The power so obtained will cease for a while during the turn of the tide, and therefore when continuous motion is required, an additional mechanism is added. On the end of the intermittently rotated shaft is a sprocket wheel, and on the shaft to be continuously rotated, which is in line with it, is another sprocket wheel; over the two wheels hangs an endless chain, in the loops of which are two weighted sheaves, one of which is much the heavier, the difference being the driving weight. When the tidal motion is rapid the excess power is stored by lifting the weight, while, when the tidal movement stops, this weight gives off its stored energy in descending, and so keeps the driving shaft in motion. The weighted sheaves are connected by a hanging chain which prevents the inequalities in the effort which would otherwise arise from the varying length of chain on the driving side.

Object entry information: This French engineer and architect proposed and published in 1615 an application of steam as a means of elevating water. His scheme required a spherical copper boiler with an internal pipe reaching nearly to the bottom, and with a cock for filling it. The boiler was to be placed on a fire until the steam pressure forced the boiling water through the vertical pipe to a height proportionate to this pressure. In an alternate scheme he proposed using the heat of the sun’s rays to increase the pressure of a confined volume of air, and thus force up some of the water upon which it pressed.

Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and a pupil of Galileo, in 1643 confirmed his instructor’s speculations that the atmosphere had weight by measuring it with his invention of what is now known as the mercurial barometer. Otto von Guericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg, directed his attention to the means of obtaining a vacuum and adapted the syringe for his purpose; in 1654 he showed his apparatus publicly. In the treatise he published in 1672 he described a number of experiments on the subject, including the one shown in the drawing in which a cylinder is fitted with a tight piston connected by a cord and overhead air-pump to a weight; when the air under the piston was exhausted by an air-pump the weight was lifted.

Object name: DRAWING OF MACHINE DESIGNED BY GIOVANNI BRANCA. Prepared in the Museum, 1897.
Maker/Donor: Giovanni Branca
Date of creation: Machine designed c. 1629. Drawing prepared 1897.
Object entry information: Branca was an Italian engineer who, in 1629, published a work in which he suggested a form of steam engine. A powerful horizontal jet of steam was to be directed against vanes on the circumference of a fan wheel with a vertical axis, thus causing the wheel to revolve. Several applications of the resulting motion were described, but that shown in the drawing consists in the use of a reducing train of spur gearing by which pestles or gravitation stamps are lifted. The alteration in the form of the jet and in that of the vanes it will, however, be seen, resemble the efficient steam turbine of Dr. de Laval (see No. 152), provided the requisite high speed could have been maintained.

Object name: DRAWING OF APPARATUS OF TORRICELLI AND VON GUERICKE. Prepared in the Museum, 1897.
Maker/Donor: Evangelista Torricelli and Otto von Guericke (Designers)
Date of creation: Original design 1643/1654. Drawing prepared 1897.
Object entry information: This drawing is inserted here to emphasize the fact that in the middle of the 17th century the discovery was made that the atmosphere had weight and that it could be excluded from a closed vessel so as to obtain a vacuum, facts essential in the development of the steam engine. Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and a pupil of Galileo, in 1643 confirmed his instructor’s speculations that the atmosphere had weight by measuring it with his invention of what is now known as the mercurial barometer. Otto von Guericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg, directed his attention to the means of obtaining a vacuum and adapted the syringe for his purpose; in 1654 he showed his apparatus publicly. In the treatise he published in 1672 he described a number of experiments on the subject, including the one shown in the drawing in which a cylinder is fitted with a tight piston connected by a cord and overhead air-pump to a weight; when the air under the piston was exhausted by an air-pump the weight was lifted. Reproductions of Guericke’s apparatus are to be found in the Physics Collection.

Maker/Donor: Edward Somerset, second Marquis of Worcester (Designer)
Date of creation: Original design 1655/1663. Drawing prepared 1897.
Object entry information: Edward Somerset, second Marquis of Worcester, in his “Century of Inventions,” which was written in 1655, although not published till 1663, included descriptions of of “a water work”; in 1663 the benefits of a “water commanding engine” were secured to the Marquis for ninety-nine years by Act of Parliament. In 1663 and 1669 eye-witnesses saw one of these engines, which had been erected by the Marquis at Vauxhall, raise water to a height of 40 ft.; this drawing is a speculative attempt to represent that engine. It shows a high pressure boiler, and two vessels into which the water to be pumped was forced by atmospheric pressure after the contained steam had condensed; this water was afterwards discharged by steam pressure on the system subsequently extensively practised by Savery.

The apparatus in its simplest form consisted of a high-pressure boiler supplying steam to a receiver, which was provided with suction and delivery pipes and the corresponding valves. By means of a regulator valve worked by hand, steam from the boiler was admitted into a receiver which, acting through it till the air had been expelled; then the supply of steam was cut off and cold water from a cistern above was turned on to the receiver which, acting as a surface condenser, condensed the steam, so forming a partial vacuum into which the water rose from the suction pipe, the delivery orifice being at the same time sealed by its valve; the entering water further assisted in this condensation. Steam was then again admitted, and by its pressure forced the water in the receiver out through the delivery valve and pipe, the suction pipe in the meantime being closed by its non-return valve.

There were to be two vertical single-acting steam cylinders, two pumps and two rocking beams; but the steam and exhaust for both cylinders were to be controlled by a single four-way cock, so that the cylinders worked alternately. The weight of each steam piston was to exceed that of the pump plunger at the other end of its beam so that the in-strokes would be done by gravity, while the exhaust steam passed into the atmosphere. The use of a non-condensing engine and of a four-way cock, which Leupold pointed out could be worked automatically, are the leading features in this proposal.

Object name: DRAWING OF NEWCOMEN'S PUMPING ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Prepared in the Museum.
Date of creation: 1897.
Object entry information: About the year 1712 Thomas Newcomen, of Dartmouth, assisted by John Cawley or Calley, introduced this machine, known as the ""atmospheric"" engine, in which were first embodied on a practical scale several of the leading features of the reciprocating steam engine. The engine was exploited under the patent granted to Savery, and, at the time, much confusion existed regarding the two inventions. Newcomen, however, by the introduction of the piston, was enabled to force water to any height, without using steam of higher than atmospheric pressure. Newcomen's pumping engine consisted of a vertical open-topped cylinder fitted with a piston which, by chains, was connected with one end of a beam; the other end of the beam was similarly connected with the vertical rods of a pump, which might be at any requisite depth and of a size suited to the lift to be performed. The centre of the beam was fitted with trunnions, so that it could oscillate, and its ends were provided with arch heads in order that the chains resting on them should remain vertical while the beam worked. The cylinder was placed on the top of the boiler, so that when a valve was opened steam could enter the cylinder and allow the piston, which was being pulled up by the weight of the pump-rods at the other end of the beam, to rise. When the piston had reached the top of the cylinder the steam was shut off, and cold water from an overhead cistern was admitted in a jet at the bottom of the cylinder, thus condensing the steam and leaving a partial vacuum, so that the piston was forced downwards by the pressure of the atmosphere; when this down or working stroke was completed, the injection water was cut off. Steam was then again admitted for the next up stroke, during which the hot water at the bottom of the cylinder was being discharged through an eduction pipe terminating in a non-return valve while air that had come in with the steam and injection water was blown out through a ""snifting"" valve, so called from the noise it made; both these were seated in cisterns filled with water. Ingress of air, which would have been fatal to the action of the engine, was prevented by keeping the top of the piston flooded with water; that which leaked past the piston was delivered with the water used for condensation, during the

Object entry information: About the year 1712 Thomas Newcomen, of Dartmouth, assisted by John Cawley or Calley, introduced this machine, known as the ""atmospheric"" engine, in which were first embodied on a practical scale several of the leading features of the reciprocating steam engine. The engine was exploited under the patent granted to Savery, and, at the time, much confusion existed regarding the two inventions. Newcomen, however, by the introduction of the piston, was enabled to force water to any height, without using steam of higher than atmospheric pressure. Newcomen's pumping engine consisted of a vertical open-topped cylinder fitted with a piston which, by chains, was connected with one end of a beam; the other end of the beam was similarly connected with the vertical rods of a pump, which might be at any requisite depth and of a size suited to the lift to be performed. The centre of the beam was fitted with trunnions, so that it could oscillate, and its ends were provided with arch heads in order that the chains resting on them should remain vertical while the beam worked. The cylinder was placed on the top of the boiler, so that when a valve was opened steam could enter the cylinder and allow the piston, which was being pulled up by the weight of the pump-rods at the other end of the beam, to rise. When the piston had reached the top of the cylinder the steam was shut off, and cold water from an overhead cistern was admitted in a jet at the bottom of the cylinder, thus condensing the steam and leaving a partial vacuum, so that the piston was forced downwards by the pressure of the atmosphere; when this down or working stroke was completed, the injection water was cut off. Steam was then again admitted for the next up stroke, during which the hot water at the bottom of the cylinder was being discharged through an eduction pipe terminating in a non-return valve while air that had come in with the steam and injection water was blown out through a ""snifting"" valve, so called from the noise it made; both these were seated in cisterns filled with water. Ingress of air, which would have been fatal to the action of the engine, was prevented by keeping the top of the piston flooded with water; that which leaked past the piston was delivered with the water used for condensation, during the

The vessels are of hammered copper, while the valve boxes and regulator are of brass and the pipes are of wood. Steam was admitted alternately into the two receivers by a single four-way regulator. The coal consumption, as determined by Smeaton in an engine built in 1774, was 30 lb. per h.p. hour in water pumped, the ""duty"" being about 7.3 millions of foot-pounds per 112 lb. of coal burnt. In a greatly improved form, with modern additions and workmanship, Savery's engine has been re-introduced, and is well known as the ""pulsometer"" steam pump (see Pumps Section).

There is evidence pointing to the belief that it was the first one constructed by him. Thomas Savery appears as joint inventor, because it was under his patent of 1698 (see No. 44) that Newcomen's engine was exploited, although it was a totally different apparatus from that of Savery. The print is the earliest known document establishing the invention of the atmospheric engine, and is of great interest as showing that, at the date of publication in 1719, automatic valve gear had been evolved; indeed there is nothing to suggest that it was not in existence in 1712. The names of Henry Beighton and Humphrey Potter have been associated with this improvement. A table of numbered references in letterpress at the sides of the print gives interesting particulars of the several parts of the plant. The principle of action of the Newcomen engine will be understood from the preceding description (No. 49). The means whereby the engine was enabled to become self-acting was a new invention of far-reaching importance. This was the valve gear which was worked by a sliding beam or plug rod attached by chains to a smaller arch-head on the beam and extended below to work a plunger pump for filling the cistern, whence injection and other water supplies were drawn. This plug rod actuated the regulator or steam valve, which was simply a sector-shaped plate, at the end of each down stroke and of each up stroke. A stirrup attached to the regulator was jerked to and fro by a Y, or forked tumbler bob, fixed to the same shaft, as were two tappets struck by pins in the plug rod. The F-shaped injection cock handle was held by a catch till tripped by a rod projecting from a buoy floating on the surface of water inside a pipe passing through the top of the boiler. A pause, whose length depended on the pressure in the boiler, would ensue with the piston at the top of the stroke. The injection cock was replaced in its catch by a pin in the plug rod. The print affords evidence that the duty of tripping the injection cock had been, at the date of the print, transferred to the ""scoggen,"" a hinged bar struck by a pin in the plug rod. The pause at the top of the stroke was suppressed so that a greater number of strokes were made in a given time; this would explain Reference 13, ""Scoggen and his Mate, who work Double to the Boy, γ is the Axis of him.""

Both the steam valve and the injection cock are actuated by pins in the plug rod. The method of working will be understood from the description above (see No. 49).
The following table shows approximately the best results obtained at various dates as the steam engine subsequently developed, the figures giving the “duty” or foot-pounds of water pumped for every 112 lb. of coal consumed:—
1718. Newcomen . . 4.3 millions.
1767. Newcomen, Beighton and Smeaton . . 7.4 ”
1774. Smeaton . . 12.5 ”
1774. Watt (separate condenser) . . 21.0 ”
1792. Watt (separate condenser and expansion) . . 39.0 ”
1816. Woolf (two stage expansion) . . 68.0 ”
1834. Cornish engine, with high pressure . . 149.0 ”
1892. Waterworks engine (three stage expansion) . . 172.0 ”
1906. Do. . . 203.0 ”
Notwithstanding their low efficiency, Newcomen engines are still working at one or two places where waste coal is available.

Object name: ATMOSPHERIC ENGINE (1791). Received 1920. Plate III, No. 1.
Maker/Donor: Francis Thompson of Ashover, Derbyshire (designed and erected).
Date of creation: 1791.
Object entry information: This atmospheric engine was designed and erected in 1791 by Francis Thompson of Ashover, Derbyshire. It was first employed at the Oakerthorpe Mine in Derbyshire until 1841 when it was re-erected at Pentrich Colliery near Ripley, where it worked until 1918; it was thus in commission, except for short intervals, for nearly a century and a quarter.
It exhibits the characteristic features of Newcomen’s engine, but embodies improvements in detail made as a result of experience by a succession of engineers, amongst them John Smeaton in 1772. These improvements consist in mounting the cylinder on a foundation instead of supporting it on beams above the boiler; the use of a mushroom type valve for the inlet steam instead of the sector sliding valve, and additions to the working gear for convenient handling.
The cylinder was cast by Smith & Co. of Chesterfield. This and other parts of the engine from various makers were brought together on the site and there erected by the contracting engineer.
The great beam was originally made of timber but was replaced at the time of re-erection by the present cast-iron beam with separate arch heads, made by the Butterley Iron Co. The beam weighs 14 tons and measures 24 ft. 8 in. between centres of piston and pump chains. The cylinder is 54 in. diam. and the piston is 11.5 in. in depth, the rods of which are connected to the beam by forged iron link-chain. The piston is packed by rope and canvas kept in place with rings and cast-iron sector plates. A cock admits water to the upper surface of the piston to flood the packing and prevent air leakage, while a deep channel around the top of the cylinder drains the excess into the hot well. Steam at a pressure of from 2 to 3 lb. was supplied from a haystack boiler through a pipe 10 in. diam., latterly, exhaust steam from a fan engine was used.
Directly below the steam inlet is placed the eduction pipe, terminating in a non-return valve situated at the bottom of the hot well, the temperature of which was 145° to 175° F. The injection is fed by an L bend under the middle of the cylinder ending in an adjustable carrot valve. The snifting valve (so called from the noise it makes when it expels the air that has entered the cylinder with the steam and injection water) takes the form of a lightly-weighted mushroom valve of gun-metal, 2 in. diam., bolted to the eduction pipe. Connected to the great beam is a smaller wooden beam operating a lift pump for raising water from the hot well to supply the gravity feed tanks above the boiler. The injection water tank contains a small balance lever and circular clack valve which was used to shut off the water when the engine was not working.

In order to meet the great demand that arose at the close of the eighteenth century for engines to turn mill work, those people who did not wish to pay the royalties for Watt’s patent engine were obliged to adapt the Newcomen engine to work rotatively. The method finally adopted was to fit the outdoor end of the beam with a connecting rod to a crank on the mill shaft, to which was fixed a fly-wheel heavily weighted on the crank side so as to store one half of the work done on the downward and restore it in the upward stroke. The flexible connection between the piston rod and beam was retained, but after 1798, when the patent for the parallel motion expired, this mechanism was usually added, as shown in the model. The cylinder is 2.2 in. diam., and the stroke 4.8 in. The steam and injection cocks are worked by tappets in a plug frame hung from the beam by a link and sliding in guides.

Object entry information: The piston is shown in the position that is reached when the engine stops working, but the weight of the pump rods would, in practice, quickly bring the piston to the top of the stroke. To start work, steam is blown through the cylinder till well heated up, the injection cock is opened by hand, and the engine maker the downward, or power stroke, by the pressure of the atmosphere on the piston. As the latter nears the bottom of its stroke, a tappet on the plug rod cuts off the injection water, and by raising the detent, which slips under it, prevents the decisive valve opening during the up-stroke. At the bottom of the stroke the steam valve is opened and the pressure on both sides of the piston being equalised, the overweight of the pump rods raises the piston. On nearing the top of its stroke the tappet on the plug rod closes the steam valve and the injection valve detent is released, thus enabling the engine to repeat the cycle of operations automatically.
The pump rods, bolted together at the top, were carried down to three separate lift pumps in the shaft, situated 120 ft., 210 ft. and 360 ft. below the surface respectively. The pumps are single acting buckets (a spare one is shown) the lowest one being 12.75 in diam., the upper ones each 12.5 in. diam., and the stroke, originally 7 ft. was altered to 6 ft. so that at its normal rate of eight pumping strokes per min. and a pressure on the piston of 7 to 7.5 lb. per sq. in., which was that considered to be the most economical in these engines, the h.p. would be 25; about 250 gallons per min. were raised to a height of 360 ft.
The engine is shown in its correct surroundings, materials having been brought from Pentrich for the purpose. (See Anderson, Trans. Inst. Min. Eng., 1917, LII, 396–445.)

Object entry information: (Scale about 1:12). This represents the atmospheric engine erected in 1790 in the “Crank Mill” at Morley, Yorks. This mill was the first in the neighbourhood to be driven by steam power, and the engine remained in use till 1875, about which time this rough model was made. In order to meet the great demand that arose at the close of the eighteenth century for engines to turn mill work, those people who did not wish to pay the royalties for Watt’s patent engine were obliged to adapt the Newcomen engine to work rotatively. The method finally adopted was to fit the outdoor end of the beam with a connecting rod to a crank on the mill shaft, to which was fixed a fly-wheel heavily weighted on the crank side so as to store one half of the work done on the downward and restore it in the upward stroke. The flexible connection between the piston rod and beam was retained, but after 1798, when the patent for the parallel motion expired, this mechanism was usually added, as shown in the model. The cylinder is 2.2 in. diam., and the stroke 4.8 in. The steam and injection cocks are worked by tappets in a plug frame hung from the beam by a link and sliding in guides. The eduction pipe for condensed steam and air terminated in a hot well. A photograph from an early sketch of the Crank Mill is adjacent. (15816)

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a copy of the drawing enrolled with William Symington's patent specification of 1787, which shows an atmospheric engine in which heat losses are diminished by confining condensation to the lower and enlarged part of the cylinder by means of a free piston or air-pump bucket resting, close to the surface of the cold water, upon two rods supported by a lever worked by tappets in the plug frame. A valve in this bucket is similarly worked so that when the cylinder has filled with steam and the piston has gone outdoors, this valve is opened, admitting the steam to the underside of the bucket, which at the same time is raised by its lever. The injection water is also delivered into this space. When steam is again admitted it closes the valve in the bucket, forces the latter down and displaces air and condensed water. A few of these engines were built, as the arrangement was not considered to be an infringement of Watt's patent for the separate condenser. The cylinder is jacketed by the hot gases passing through a helical flue on their way from the boiler to the chimney. A method of transforming reciprocating into continuous rotative motion by means of two ratchets and of two racks suspended from the engine beam is shown. This mechanism and the engine are interesting, as they were used by Symington in very early experiments on steam navigation (see Marine Engi- neering Collection).

Eng., 1903, 681.)

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is a copy of the drawing enrolled with William Symington's patent specification of 1787, which shows an atmospheric engine in which heat losses are diminished by confining condensation to the lower and enlarged part of the cylinder by means of a free piston or air-pump bucket resting, close to the surface of the cold water, upon two rods supported by a lever worked by tappets in the plug frame. A valve in this bucket is similarly worked so that when the cylinder has filled with steam and the piston has gone outdoors, this valve is opened, admitting the steam to the underside of the bucket, which at the same time is raised by its lever. The injection water is also delivered into this space. When steam is again admitted it closes the valve in the bucket, forces the latter down and displaces air and condensed water. A few of these engines were built, as the arrangement was not considered to be an infringement of Watt's patent for the separate condenser. The cylinder is jacketed by the hot gases passing through a helical flue on their way from the boiler to the chimney. A method of transforming reciprocating into continuous rotative motion by means of two ratchets and of two racks suspended from the engine beam is shown. This mechanism and the engine are interesting, as they were used by Symington in very early experiments on steam navigation (see Marine Engi- neering Collection).

Object entry information: This, although incomplete, shows an original apparatus probably dating from 1765, by which James Watt demonstrated the soundness of his first invention in connection with the steam engine, the subject of his patent of 1769. It consists of a steam jacketed cylinder 1.4 in. diam. fitted with a hemp- packed piston. From the piston a rod passed downward through a gland and terminated in a hook from which a weight of 18 lb. was suspended. At the side of the cylinder is a vertical pipe closed at the top, but opening into the cylinder, and secured below into a metal box. From the top of this box also passes upward a vertical tube which was the barrel of the air-pump. From

Object entry information: This model, which was probably made very shortly after No. 62, is complete, and shows an excellent surface condenser and air-pump. The condenser is circular, and is traversed by 140 small tubes soldered into a metal tube plate at each end. The cooling water passes through the interior of the tubes. A vertical air-pump is attached to the side of the casing, and consists of two tubes united below. The short one is the barrel of the air-pump and is fitted with a solid piston. The longer one is fitted with a delivery valve at the top, and a suction valve where it is connected with the lower end of the condenser. The exhaust steam entered the upper portion of the condenser, and the lower outlet opened into the column of the air-pump in such a way that the rising and falling of the water column with the motion of the air-pump piston removed all air from the condensed water. In this way an excellent vacuum would be maintained, and modern engine air-pumps are only found efficient when they accord with the principles here observed by Watt.
Through the difficulty found in maintaining this form of condenser tight, Watt soon discarded it for the jet form, but now with improved methods of construction the tubular surface condenser is the form most in use, chiefly owing to the supply of pure water that it gives ready for returning into the boiler.

Object entry information: The parts here preserved belonged to the “Old Bess” pumping engine which was erected in 1777 by James Watt at Matthew Boulton's manufactory, Soho, near Birmingham. The engine embodied the separate condenser, the first improvement made by Watt upon Newcomen's engine. Watt first knew him was a manufacturer of ornamental metal articles and used water-wheels to drive his machinery. In dry weather when the flow diminished six to ten horses had to be brought in to assist; to lessen such expense, this pumping engine was installed to pump water from the tail race back to the head race, as shown by the adjoining model (see No. 66), a practice not unknown even after Watt had made his engine rotative. The steam cylinder is 33 in. diam., the stroke is 7 ft. and the pump is 24 in. diam. On being dismantled a small furnace beneath the steam cylinder was discovered. It is known that in his very early engines Watt used such a furnace to re-evaporate the water which condensed in the steam case and thus reduce steam consumption.
The engine remained in use till 1848, when the business was discontinued. The original parts are the steam cylinder; the piston and piston rod, shown apart; the beam complete with chains and plummer blocks; and one length of pump barrel.

Object entry information: This model, which has been constructed from the data given by the existing portions of the engine, together with those on two early drawings, shows the general arrangement of the engine erected at Boulton’s manufactory at Soho in 1777.
James Watt’s first steam engine was constructed and tried at Kinneil in Scotland in 1769, and was sent to Birmingham in 1773. At Kinneil the engine, although it had a separate condenser (see No. 62) and embodied other improvements, was hardly a success owing to its defective mechanical construction. When Watt joined Boulton the engine and boiler were conveyed from Scotland by water via Hull to Birmingham, and for two years the engine was being rebuilt and improved, until, with a new bored cast-iron cylinder, 2 ft. stroke, it worked fairly well. It was known as “Beelzebub,” and had an 18 in. cylinder, 5 ft. stroke, and worked an 18·5 in. pump against a 24 ft. head. In 1777 it was injured by fire, and “Old Bess” was constructed immediately afterwards; it was, however, of considerably more power, as the steam cylinder is 33 in. diam. with a 7 ft. stroke, and the pump has a diam. of 24 in. Its duty was to pump water from the tail-race back into the head-race of a water-wheel of 24 ft. diam. and 6 ft. breast, at times when the stream flow was insufficient. This indirect method of obtaining rotatory motion by steam power had previously been employed in London and elsewhere. Long after the introduction of the rotative steam engine, however, this method of driving was still practised for textile machinery, owing to the more regular motion that it was considered was obtainable by the intervention of a water-wheel. The power lost must, however, have been considerable, for if the mechanical efficiency of the water-wheel and its gearing was 50 per cent. and that of the pumps 80 per cent., the combined efficiency could only be 40 per cent., which would be only one-half of the mechanical efficiency of a directly rotative engine, so that twice the amount of coal then necessary would be consumed in doing the required work.

The condenser, which is very small, is arranged in a tank, and by its side is the air-pump, which is driven by a prolongation of the plug rod. The valve gear is of the latch type driven by tappets from the plug rod. The parallel motion for the plug rod is derived from the parallel point by an additional pantograph. The pump is in a large wooden tank, and has its bucket weighted with lead to represent the heavy spear rods of a mining pump.

In 1777 it was injured by fire, and “Old Bess” was constructed immediately afterwards; it was, however, of considerably more power, as the steam cylinder is 33 in. diam. with a 7 ft. stroke, and the pump has a diam. of 24 in. Its duty was to pump water from the tail-race back into the head-race of a water-wheel of 24 ft. diam. and 6 ft. breast, at times when the stream flow was insufficient. This indirect method of obtaining rotatory motion by steam power had previously been employed in London and elsewhere. Long after the introduction of the rotative steam engine, however, this method of driving was still practised for textile machinery, owing to the more regular motion that it was considered was obtainable by the intervention of a water-wheel. The power lost must, however, have been considerable, for if the mechanical efficiency of the water-wheel and its gearing was 50 per cent. and that of the pumps 80 per cent., the combined efficiency could only be 40 per cent., which would be only one-half of the mechanical efficiency of a directly rotative engine, so that twice the amount of coal then necessary would be consumed in doing the required work.","Inv. 1894-151, 21, 530, S.M. 229.","Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

It is now usually known as the ""Bull"" engine, owing to its having been introduced and constructed on a practical scale by Edward Bull, who, in conjunction with Trevithick, erected several important pumping plants in Cornwall. They were, however, infringing Watt's patents, and in 1793-5 were stopped by legal proceedings. The cylinder is supported over the pumping shaft by beams extending across the engine house, and the main rod passes through the bottom of the cylinder and is directly attached to the pump spears, the weight of which performed the downward stroke of the pump (in the model it is assisted by a leaden weight). Beneath the cylinder is a short rocking beam by which some of the weight of the spears is counterbalanced, and from which the motion for the valve gear and air-pump is obtained. From the sectional model it is seen that the exhaust pipe is provided with a jet and used as a condenser, which is cleared by a vertical air-pump; the jet is, however, intermittent, being controlled by the valve gear so that it is only turned on during the exhaust stroke.

Maker/Donor: Prepared in the Museum.
Date of creation: 1897
Object entry information: This represents the arrangement supplied by Messrs. Boulton and Watt in 1788, but it differs only in detail from the standard Cornish pumping engine subsequently so extensively used. The engine valves are of the drop type, connected by racks and segmental arms with levers struck by tappets on the plug or air-pump rod; the top valve admits steam to the cylinder and was known as the ""expansion"" valve, as it was shut off when the piston was at about half-stroke, thereby allowing the remainder of the stroke to be performed by the expansion of the steam previously admitted which performed the work upon the boiler. The lower or ""equilibrium"" valve is opened when the piston reaches the bottom of its stroke, thus allowing the steam above the piston to pass to the lower side, so that by the weight of the pump-rods the piston ascends to the upper end of the cylinder. The lowest valve controls the passage from the lower end of the cylinder to the condenser, and is open throughout the down-stroke of the piston. The well-known high economy of these engines is largely due to their acting somewhat as if compounded, since the upper portion of the piston and cylinder are never exposed to the low temperature of steam discharging into the condenser; the cylinder also has a steam jacket. The closed top cylinder here employed was introduced by Watt in 1774. The boiler shown is of the ""wagon"" type (see No. 340), and probably worked at about 5 lb. per sq. in. above atmospheric pressure.

Maker/Donor: JAMES WATT.
Date of creation: 1876
Object entry information: This is a double cylinder engine in which both cylinders are single-acting but have their piston rods connected by a chain, so that working alternately they are equivalent to one double-acting cylinder. The chain passes over and is fixed to a grooved wheel carrying a crank pin at the back, which would drive a connecting or pump-rod. The upper ends of the cylinders are closed but in free communication, and a non-return valve in each piston will permit steam to pass upward into this space. Below each cylinder is an air pump and condenser, the air-pump rods being connected by a chain passing over and fixed to a smaller wheel (now missing) on the overhead shaft. At the foot of each cylinder is a steam valve and an exhaust valve, by which communication is opened alternately with the boiler and the jet-condenser which is in the eduction pipe leading to the air-pump.

Date of creation: 1788 (Erected)
Object entry information: This is a very early example of the double-acting rotative beam engine with separate condenser and air pump, constructed by James Watt. It was erected at Soho Manufactory, near Birmingham, in 1788, where it was known as the “Lap” engine because of its use for driving machinery for lapping or polishing steel ornaments. It continued at work till 1858. The framing is entirely of timber bound together by straps and bolts. The cylinder is 18.75 in. diam. by 4 ft. stroke, and Watt's parallel motion is used to transmit the movement of the piston to the beam. The latter is of timber, equal-armed, and actuates by a cast-iron connecting rod and sun and planet gearing (see No. 174), a mortice-toothed flywheel which at Soho drove two pinions 3 ft. diam. from the shafts of which motion was communicated by belts or gearing to 43 metal-working machines. The weight of the connecting rod and planet wheel is counterbalanced by a cast-iron block bolted on the opposite end of the beam. The nozzles to the cylinder were fitted in 1833 to replace the original ones. The valves are operated by tappets on a rod which serves also to work the air pump. The steam admission for one end of the cylinder and the exhaust valve for the other are released and then acted on by a weight while the corresponding valves are held closed by a detent. An early example of Watt's slow-speed centrifugal governor is driven by a chain and regulates the supply of steam by a disc throttle valve. The steam is condensed partly by a jet adjustable by hand and partly by the water in the tank surrounding the condenser. The air pump is 13.5 in. diam. by 22 in. stroke, the condensing water pump is 6.5 in. diam. by 20 in. stroke, and the feed pump is 3.5 in. diam. by 11 in. stroke. The flywheel is 15.76 ft. pitch diam., 5.12 in. wide with 296 mortice teeth. It is of cast iron built up in segments. (N.B.—This flywheel has been completed in wood to replace the half not preserved.) The engine was nominally of 10 h.p. but indicated 13.75 h.p.

The connecting rod from the valve can be disengaged, with a gab end, so that it can be disengaged, and the valves be worked by hand levers when required in starting the engine. The engine was probably made with a tappet motion in the first case, and the motion above described added at the later date.

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: 1876
Object entry information: This model was probably made about the year 1800, as the valve gear and general arrangements are improvements upon those in the actual engine, No. 75, erected in 1797. The framing is of timber, supported under the beam gudgeon by a metal column carried on a masonry pedestal. The beam is a casting, and has its terminal pins carried in trunnion hoops which adjust themselves to any inaccuracy in the erection. The valves are of the drop type, two for each end of the cylinder; the stem of the lower valve passes through the tubular stem of the upper one, rendering only one opening into the steam box necessary while simplifying the mechanism. The valves are driven by a quiet tappet gear from a horizontal shaft rocked by an eccentric on the crank-shaft, but the valve gear does not permit of expansive working.
The beam is fitted with Watt's parallel motion, and by the looping of the lower tie rod the air-pump rod is directly connected with the parallel point, in the way that has since been generally followed. The condenser is cylindrical and is enclosed in a water tank. To the top of the condenser is secured the air-pump, the discharge of which is led off by a shoot. The injection water is conveyed to the condenser by a horizontal pipe from outside the tank. The top cover of the air-pump is guided as in No. 78. The steam cylinder is 1.625 in. diam. by 4.5 in. stroke.

Object entry information: This represents a double-acting rotative engine. The framing, the beam, and the connecting rod are of wood. Watt’s parallel motion and his sun and planet gear (see No. 174) are fitted. To obtain a straight line motion for the air-pump rod and to avoid fouling the rods of the main parallelogram, the latter is extended as a pantograph to give a guided point for attaching the rod. Tappets on this rod strike a fork keyed to an internally toothed segment gearing with teeth on the plug of a four-way cock for admission and exhaust of steam to the cylinder. An engine embodying this valve gear but with cast-iron, etc., beam, was in use in 1808 at Southwark. A circular saw arranged on a bench is driven by a band from the engine.

Object entry information: This engine was the property of James Watt, who bequeathed it to Mr. John Kennedy, of Manchester; it may be said to represent the steam engine as left by Watt. It is a small double-acting beam engine with a separate jet condenser and air-pump. The slide valve is of the long D form; the cylinder is steam-jacketed. Watt’s parallel motion is employed to guide the top of the piston-rod and the air-pump rod. The simple crank and connecting rod is used to secure rotative motion. The slide valve is worked by a single eccentric, and the speed of the engine is controlled by Watt’s conical pendulum governor, which acts on a throttle valve in the steam passage. The cast-iron tank, standards, and beam, together with the general arrangement of the engine, hardly differed from those of similar engines of 50 years subsequently.

The valve is of the long D type, which was patented in 1799 by William Murdock, of the firm of Boulton and Watt, but which was not introduced till after 1800, when Watt, who preferred the drop type of valve, had retired. The live steam is always round the waist of the valve. The exhaust from the upper end of the cylinder passes to the condenser through the tubular centre, the exhaust from the lower end passing directly to the condenser.

The cylinder is vertical and double-acting, and by two vertical connecting rods oscillates the horizontal arm of a bell-crank. From the vertical arm of the bell-crank a horizontal connecting rod proceeds to a crank on the fly-wheel shaft. A vertical air-pump is provided and is driven from the bell-crank. The engine foundation and the condenser tank are formed by one casting which carries the crank-shaft bearing. The steam is distributed by a long D slide valve worked by an elliptical cam bolted to the fly-wheel arms. These engines were made of from 4 to 8 h.p.; one was supplied in 1805 for Robert Fulton’s paddle steam “Clermont”; another was in use at the Soho works till 1896.

Object name: HESLOP’S BEAM ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Presented by the Earl of Lonsdale, 1878.
Date of creation: 1878
Object entry information: Adam Heslop patented in 1790 a rotative beam engine in which, by employing two cylinders, he claimed advantages equivalent to those of a single-acting cylinder with Watt’s separate condenser, at a time when the latter’s patent was still in force. There is some evidence that it was considered an infringement, but no legal action was taken. The invention was first tried in the neighbourhood of Coalbrookdale; later some fourteen engines, of which this was one, were built in the Whitehaven district. The engine was erected about 1795 at Kell’s Pit, Whitehaven, and was used subsequently for winding and pumping at other pits in the district until its removal to South Kensington in 1878. There are two open-topped cylinders, one known as the “hot” cylinder near the connecting rod end of the beam, the other or “cold” cylinder being at the other extremity; in some cases both cylinders were at the same end.

Maker/Donor: Lent by W. W. S. Westwood, Esq., 1894. (Lent by)
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This shows a method of obtaining rotative motion from an open-topped cylinder provided with Watt's separate condenser. To get over the difficulty of there being only one working stroke per revolution, the connecting rod is so weighted as to store one half of the work done in that stroke and restore it during the idle stroke. It is true that Watt contemplated, in his patent of 1782, using an expedient of this kind for his single-acting engines, but it is difficult to believe that it was ever adopted, because his double-acting engine followed immediately after. Atmospheric engines, however, had to be so arranged to make them work rotatively (see No. 58) and large numbers were employed in the Midlands in the early part of the 19th century under the name of whimseys. For pumping, a similar arrangement is known to have been adopted (see No. 93). The model bears internal evidence of having been made subsequent to 1800; it was for many years at Corbyn's Hall Ironworks, Staffordshire, whither it is said to have been sent from Soho Foundry. It was at one time used for driving a lathe. The cylinder is 2·6 in. diam. and the stroke 3 in.; the piston rod is guided by Watt's parallel motion (1784), but the air-pump rod is hung from the end of the radius rod, instead of from a parallel point. The condenser and air-pump stand in the hot well; the former has a cock on the side and a drop valve, by which the injection could be regulated. The steam and exhaust drop valves are driven by a countershaft from an eccentric, a mechanism introduced for this purpose by Murdock in 1800.

The piston is forced downward by steam pressure until it nearly reaches the bottom of its stroke, when a spring on the crosshead closes the steam valve; the spindle of an exhaust valve in the piston afterwards strikes the cylinder bottom, and so permits the steam to escape into the condenser, thus allowing the piston to pass again to the top of the cylinder under the action of the fly-wheel.

Maker/Donor: Museum (Maker)
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This model shows Cartwright's mechanism for converting the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion. The engine itself presented several exceptional features (see No. 94), but the only other one of these followed in this model is that the valve motion is directly derived from that of the piston by a tappet action. The arrangement for guiding the end of the piston-rod, in place of the then general parallel motion, comprised a long crosshead secured to the piston-rod and revolving in opposite directions. In this way the oblique thrusts of the two connecting rods were caused to neutralise each other, and the piston-rod had only to resist the direct piston effort, which it was able to do without the assistance of a parallel motion or other form of guide. This arrangement of mechanism was abandoned for many years, but it is now successfully employed for driving the two revolving prisms in the rotary form of air-pump know as a ""pressure blower""; in such cases, however, the engine crosshead is also provided with slide guides, as shown in an attached illustration.

Date of creation: 1785 (Constructed); 1894 (Lent date)
Object entry information: This is the original model stated to have been constructed in 1785 by William Murdock at Soho. The cylinder is 1.5 in. diam., 4 in. stroke, and double-acting. It is made of wood, and so was probably tried only with compressed air—a method of driving that was afterwards practically adopted by Murdock for power transmission. The framing consists of two ""A"" frames well braced together and supporting the shaft, which is furnished at one end with an over-hanging crank, and at the other with a large fly-wheel. The crank pin is directly attached to the piston-rod—the cylinder oscillating on central trunnions. The piston is short and long, so that through which the working fluid is introduced, while the other is merely a mechanical support. From the inlet passage the driving fluid passes by a channel to a valve chest on the side of the cylinder. The valve is a long piston of square section greatly reduced in the centre, which is the steam space. The exhaust escapes by the open ends beyond the valve. The valve spindle is continued upward, and by a V-shaped link is attached to a stationary point on the same level as the trunnions. The oscillation of the cylinder causes

Object entry information: This is a form of high pressure engine which, combined with the return flue boiler, was patented by Trevithick and Vivian in 1802, and subsequently extensively used for locomotives as well as semi-portable engines.
The boiler shell is of cast iron 1 in. thick, 3.6 ft. diam., and 5.5 ft. long; the back end, which is dished, is cast with it, while the front of the shell has a flange to which the wrought iron front of the boiler is secured by bolts. To this front the two ends of the return, or horseshoe, flue are riveted; the larger leg of the flue is 18 in. diam. and holds the grate, the return portion being only 10 in. diam. The front of the boiler also has a manhole, but the system of construction rendered the whole interior readily accessible for scaling and repairs, owing to the ease with which the boiler front and furnace could be removed.
The steam generated passed into a cast-iron steam dome, surmounted by a 2 in. lever-weighted safety-valve, from which it was led by an external pipe to the valve chest of the steam cylinder, which is 9.5 in. diam. by about 36 in. stroke. The cylinder is arranged vertically, and is steam jacketed, being almost immersed in the boiler to which it is secured by an upper flange. The boiler steam, after passing through a stop valve of the plug type, is admitted alternately to the two ends of the cylinder by a four-way plug valve worked by a tappet motion.

Object entry information: This is a form of high pressure engine which, combined with the return flue boiler, was patented by Trevithick and Vivian in 1802, and subsequently extensively used for locomotives as well as semi-portable engines.
The boiler shell is of cast iron 1 in. thick, 3.6 ft. diam., and 5.5 ft. long; the back end, which is dished, is cast with it, while the front of the shell has a flange to which the wrought iron front of the boiler is secured by bolts. To this front the two ends of the return, or horseshoe, flue are riveted; the larger leg of the flue is 18 in. diam. and holds the grate, the return portion being only 10 in. diam. The front of the boiler also has a manhole, but the system of construction rendered the whole interior readily accessible for scaling and repairs, owing to the ease with which the boiler front and furnace could be removed.
The steam generated passed into a cast-iron steam dome, surmounted by a 2 in. lever-weighted safety-valve, from which it was led by an external pipe to the valve chest of the steam cylinder, which is 9.5 in. diam. by about 36 in. stroke. The cylinder is arranged vertically, and is steam jacketed, being almost immersed in the boiler to which it is secured by an upper flange. The boiler steam, after passing through a stop valve of the plug type, is admitted alternately to the two ends of the cylinder by a four-way plug valve worked by a tappet motion.

Object entry information: This form of “portable” or self-contained condensing beam engine was brought out in 1805 by Matthew Murray, of Leeds. It proved in practice to be not easily accessible, and only a few engines were therefore made. It is interesting, nevertheless, as having the same general arrangement as the side-lever engine which subsequently became the recognised type for marine purposes. The engine is contained within a tank supported on four feet. A dividing partition enables the cylinder and valve box to be packed with non-conduct-ing material, while the air-pump and condenser are surrounded by water. The cylinder crosshead has two side rods working on to a pin on the end of a beam rocking on a centre on the underside of the tank. The other end of the beam has a connecting rod to a crankshaft above, with a large fly-wheel. The air-pump is worked similarly by side rods from an intermediate point in the beam. Neither cylinder nor air-pump crossheads are guided. Steam is dis-tributed to the cylinder by the “locomotive” slide-valve which had been patented by Murray in 1802. The valve has a rack on the back geared into by a sector which is actuated by a rod having a frame at the other end embracing a cam on the crankshaft; the cam gives a period of rest at the end of each stroke. The injection cock to the condenser can be adjusted by a hand lever moving over an index plate. The engines actually made were of 6 h.p.; the small example shown has a cylinder 3 in. diam. by 5 in. stroke.

By these arrangements a guided straight line motion is obtained without the use of links or guides, while, owing to there being no extension of the piston-rod or anything beyond it, the engine is remarkably compact, Murray’s mechanism possesses the further advantages of giving a true harmonic motion, and having all its parts revolving so that they can be directly balanced, while there is a total absence of oblique thrust. For these reasons it is, although now no longer used in steam engines, still extensively adopted for giving reciprocating motion to the tables of flat-bed printing machines as shown by a model in another Section.

Object entry information: This form of “portable” or self-contained condensing beam engine was brought out in 1805 by Matthew Murray, of Leeds. It proved in practice to be not easily accessible, and only a few engines were therefore made. It is interesting, nevertheless, as having the same general arrangement as the side-lever engine which subsequently became the recognised type for marine purposes. The engine is contained within a tank supported on four feet. A dividing partition enables the cylinder and valve box to be packed with non-conduct-ing material, while the air-pump and condenser are surrounded by water. The cylinder crosshead has two side rods working on to a pin on the end of a beam rocking on a centre on the underside of the tank. The other end of the beam has a connecting rod to a crankshaft above, with a large fly-wheel. The air-pump is worked similarly by side rods from an intermediate point in the beam. Neither cylinder nor air-pump crossheads are guided. Steam is dis-tributed to the cylinder by the “locomotive” slide-valve which had been patented by Murray in 1802. The valve has a rack on the back geared into by a sector which is actuated by a rod having a frame at the other end embracing a cam on the crankshaft; the cam gives a period of rest at the end of each stroke. The injection cock to the condenser can be adjusted by a hand lever moving over an index plate. The engines actually made were of 6 h.p.; the small example shown has a cylinder 3 in. diam. by 5 in. stroke.

Object entry information: Received 1879. Plate IV., No. 1. This early high-pressure engine and boiler were made by Richard Trevithick in 1811 at Hayle Foundry, Cornwall, for Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., of Trewithen, and were in constant use for thrashing, chaff-cutting, and similar work, until removed to South Kensington in 1879. It is stated that this was the first steam engine that drove a thrashing machine. The boiler is of the Cornish type, 7 ft. long by 4.5 ft. diam., with a single internal flue 27 in. diam.; beyond the fire bridge the circular shape is departed from, one side of the flue being flattened so that the section is 28 in. by 21 in. The products of combustion from the furnace flue were led by a “wheel draught” through external masonry flues to the chimney, the total heating surface so obtained being probably about 50 sq. ft. The shell of the boiler is shaped at the top so as to receive the steam cylinder, which is open-topped and placed in the boiler so as to be steam-jacketed. The safety valve is weighted for a maximum pressure of 40 lb. above the atmosphere. The cylinder is 9.5 in. diam. by 26 in. stroke, and the long connecting rod, which is attached directly to the piston, passes up to a crank on a fly-wheel shaft above. The fly-wheel is 10 ft. diam., with a grooved rim for a driving rope, and has cast on it a balance weight that assists the return stroke of the piston. Steam distribution is by a four-way cock which is rocked by a cam on the crankshaft. The feed pump is worked by a lever from the piston.

Date of creation: c. 1815
Object entry information: This engine was employed for general purposes at a salt works at Ingestre, near Stafford, for upwards of half a century; it has been disused since 1882, when the works were closed down. It is said to have been removed thither from Brereton, near Rugeley, where it had been used in winding from a coal pit. Nothing is known as to the maker of the engine, but it exhibits several features that were peculiar to the designs of Richard Trevithick, the pioneer in the adoption of high-pressure steam, some of whose engines are known to have been constructed at Bridgnorth about 1815. The engine is later than those (Nos. 98 and 105) shown near at hand, in that the cylinder is separated from the boiler and has an independent framing. The engine is of the vertical, return connecting-rod type, with a cylinder 7 in. diam. by 24 in. stroke. Steam admission and exhaust are controlled by a four-way cock, the lever or spanner of which is struck by two tappets adjustable on a tappet rod hanging from the crosshead, in a similar way to that in Trevithick’s road locomotive model (see the Road Transport Section). The tail of this spanner has a strap attached to limit its fall below the point where the tappet can again strike it. The area of both the steam and exhaust ports in the four-way cock is 1.25 sq. in. There was no governor, but there was a stop-cock on the steam pipe. The exhaust steam passes to a feed water heater of the form adopted by Trevithick in the high-pressure engine which he applied to a dredger in 1803; he foresaw the desirability of saving some of the heat rejected in the exhaust steam. The heater consists merely of a casing surrounding about 4 ft. of the feed pipe which passes through stuffing boxes at either end. The casing is prevented from shifting by iron loops. The feed pump, 2.125 in. diam. by 5.5 in. stroke, is worked from a pin driven into the space between the boss of the pinion and the crankshaft, on one end of the latter. Interesting details of early machine construction may be noted, such as the square cast-iron crankshaft with its narrow bearings, bridles for holding cocks on their seats, and the method of staying the crosshead guides.

Maker/Donor: Maudslay Collection, 1900.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: The double-cylinder diagonal engine with a single crank was designed and patented in 1822 by Sir M. I. Brunel chiefly for use as a marine engine. The model shows the design as modified by the use of oscillating cylinders, and is believed to represent an engine built by Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field, for working the drainage pumps used during the construction of the Thames Tunnel, 1825–42. The cylinders are each 0.77 in. diam. by 1.43 in. stroke, and incline upward, at 45 deg., to the single crankshaft. Each cylinder is double-acting, and the steam distribution is performed through ports in one of the trunnions, which, by its oscillation, acts as a slide-valve. As Joseph Maudslay had in 1827 introduced a much more efficient valve-gear for this class of engine (see Marine Engineering Collection), the motor represented was probably made during the early stage of the tunnel works.

Object entry information: This is a low-pressure engine of the established beam type, and may be taken as representative of practice during the period of twenty or thirty years after the expiration in 1800 of Watt’s patent for the separate condenser, when other engineers could enter the field on equal terms. The engine is believed to have come originally from South Lancashire. It worked at Littler's Rock Mine, Marston, Cheshire, from early in the century up to 1852. It was taken out and converted into a pumping engine, and in that state worked until 1900, when it was again altered to a winding engine and put up at the Fletcher and Rigby Mine, Marston, perhaps the oldest rock salt mine in England. Its duty, which was to lift tubs of rock salt weighing 1 ton from a depth of 330 ft., was performed intermittently until 1910, when rearrangements rendered the engine superfluous. It will be noted that timber framing has now been finally discarded; the base plate, central column, and entablature (cross-shaped in plan) are wholly of cast iron. The engine is, however, not quite self-contained, in that the ends of the base and entablature are built into the walls of the engine house. The steam cylinder is double-acting, and is secured to a rectangular cast-iron beam which is bolted to the tank containing the condensing chamber and air pump. The valves are actuated in such a manner that when the piston reaches the end of its stroke, a tappet on the air pump rod closes one set of valves, simultaneously opening the steam valve to the top of the cylinder and the exhaust to the condensing chamber. The exhaust steam is condensed by the action of a continuously operating jet of water assisted by the surrounding water. The jet was regulated by hand to maintain a constant head of water in tank. The air pump is connected to the condenser chamber by a rectangular pipe having a non-return valve between the two, a similar valve being situated inside the hot well. The capacity of the air pump is large owing to the fact that the injection was always full on, and that steam was admitted throughout the length of the stroke. The cylinder is 18 in. diam. as rebored, by 4 ft. stroke; the air pump is 12 in. diam. by 2 ft. stroke; the beam of cast iron is unequal armed, measuring 6.66 ft. between centre of piston and beam and 6.5 ft. between beam and connecting rod; the crank throw is consequently 23.4 in. Both crank and connecting rod are of cast iron. The fly-wheel, 12.5 ft. diam., is built up as a spider with 8 segmental arms breaking joint. Steam at a pressure of 5 to 10 lb. per sq. in. was supplied by an egg-ended boiler. The speed was 12–15 r.p.m., so that the engine must have developed about 15 h.p.

Object entry information: This is a small example of the self-contained non-condensing beam engine made about 1830–40 for factory purposes. It was in use till 1905 for driving a set of drying rolls. The cylinder is 7.25 in. diam. by 14 in. stroke. The slide valve is of unusual design, being a hollow box, shaped like a flat inverted U, the legs of which slide on a flat seating joining the cylinder ports and forming the front of the valve chest. Live steam surrounds the valve and passes underneath to the inside edges of the steam ports, while the exhaust takes place through the interior of the valve to a port at the lower end of the valve face which leads to an exit in the base of the cylinder. A spring on the back of the valve keeps it to its face when steam is shut off. The valve is actuated by an eccentric with a gab-ended rod. A butterfly valve throttled by a Watt centrifugal governor controls steam admission to the valve chest. An interesting feature is the parallel motion, which is a modification of that of Watt; the radius rod is centred at a point above and half way between the end of the beam and its gudgeon, while the link connecting the end of the radius rod and the beam is extended to the parallel point, to which the piston rod is attached. This form of motion is compact and simple, and does not require the pantagraph of the ordinary Watt motion. The framing and entablature of the engine is in the classical style which was much affected in the early years of the 19th century.

Object entry information: The twin-cylinder or “Siamese” engine, patented in 1839 by Joseph Mauds lay and Joshua Field for marine purposes (see Marine Engineering Collection) was modified for land use in exceptional cases, as here shown; the advantage of the arrangement is that a long stroke can be accommodated in a limited height, but mechanically it is undesirable, so that few were made; in common with the “table” (see No. 103) and other engines of this time it was superseded by the direct-acting type. The two cylinders have a common crosshead, which is of a T-shape, working in guides between the cylinders; it is formed of two plates between which swings the connecting rod, whose point of attachment is at the tail of the T while its big end joins to the crankshaft overhead. The valve is a simple four-way cock, the lever of which is actuated by an eccentric.

The device was patented in 1839 by Elijah Galloway, but was not practically used until considerably later (see Nos. 124 and 125). Two vertical simple cylinders are placed side by side, with the crankshaft between them, and the piston-rods are connected by return links from the ends of the base of a triangular frame, the apex of which embraces the crankpin, while the middle point of the base is constrained to move in a vertical line.

Object entry information: The twin-cylinder or “Siamese” engine, patented in 1839 by Joseph Mauds lay and Joshua Field for marine purposes (see Marine Engineering Collection) was modified for land use in exceptional cases, as here shown; the advantage of the arrangement is that a long stroke can be accommodated in a limited height, but mechanically it is undesirable, so that few were made; in common with the “table” (see No. 103) and other engines of this time it was superseded by the direct-acting type. The two cylinders have a common crosshead, which is of a T-shape, working in guides between the cylinders; it is formed of two plates between which swings the connecting rod, whose point of attachment is at the tail of the T while its big end joins to the crankshaft overhead. The valve is a simple four-way cock, the lever of which is actuated by an eccentric.

Object entry information: Two high-pressure single-cylinder vertical engines of the form introduced by William Fairbairn are here combined to drive one overhead shaft. The engines were built by Messrs. William Fairbairn & Co., of Manchester, about 1840, for the railway locomotive shops at Norwich, and remained in use till 1922, when electric motors were substituted for the duty.
The framing is in the form of a hollow column resting on a box from which the cylinder depends. The box is supported by two cast-iron girders which are built into the wall of the engine house, thus doing away with the necessity for heavy foundations and economising space. The cylinders are 12.6 in. diam. (bored out from 12 in.) by 30 in. stroke. The slide valve is of the loco. pattern actuated by an eccentric; the exhaust is carried away below the floor. Speed is controlled by a Watt governor to each cylinder driven by bevel gear from the crankshaft and acting upon a butterfly valve in the steam pipe. As fitted, each cylinder could run alone, e.g., when shops were not on full load or when repairs were necessary. In 1920 this contingency did arise owing to a breakdown, and for a week the engine worked satisfactorily with one cylinder. The stop valve is worked by a handle placed close to the column. At 41 r.p.m. and boiler pressure of 125 lb. per sq. in. the estimated h.p. was 145. The spur fly-wheel is 10 ft. 2.5 in. diam. at the pitch line, giving 92 r.p.m. on the shop shafting.
These engines were made in sizes from 6 to 30 h.p., the boiler pressure being about 60 lb. per sq. in.

The speed is regulated by a belt- driven Watt governor, carried on the top of the cylinder casing and control- ling the steam supply by a disc throttle-valve. The feed delivery pipe is fitted with a weighted relief valve, so that when the feed pipe of the boiler is closed the water pumped can return to the hot-well.

Object entry information: This sectional model represents one of two engines, 8 in. diam. by 10 in. stroke and of 8 h.p., which were used at the Royal Albert Hall from 1871 till 1909 to drive two ventilating fans. They were constructed by Mr. J. Robertson under his patent of 1868. A connecting rod is dispensed with, as the cross-head actuates the crank- disc directly by sliding through a ball socketed eccentrically within it. This mechanism gives to the piston-rod and piston a helical motion which is made use of to distribute the steam. To this end, the piston is made so much longer

Maker/Donor: Contributed by J. Warriner, Esq. / Patented by Mr. J. Milner
Date of creation: 1857. / 1853 (patent)
Object entry information: This design for a two-stage expansion engine was patented by Mr. J. Milner in 1853. The cylinders are side by side, with the valve chests between them, and the cranks at right angles. Reversal is effected by loose eccentrics, and a piston-valve which inter-changes the exhaust and steam passages. The steam is first admitted into the smaller cylinder and is cut off at half stroke; it is then led to the larger cylinder whose piston is at the commence- ment of its stroke. While the piston is at the end of its stroke, this steam will have been doing work while expanding to a volume equal to that of the low- pressure cylinder and half the high pressure. This method of working causes, however, an exceptional temperature range in the high-pressure cylinder.

Object entry information: This three-cylinder engine was patented by Mr. Fuller in 1853. It would now be described as a two-stage expansion engine with one high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders. The cranks are equally spaced at 120 deg., this arrangement being adopted with the intention of obtaining uniform turning moment. In the model the central cylinder is the high-pressure one; by using two low-pressure cylinders a single cylinder of inconveniently large dimensions is avoided. Into the ports are fitted cylindrical plug-valves, by rotating which the distribution of the steam to the cylinders can be varied. To assist in following the action, the high-pressure steam ports and spaces are coloured red and the low-pressure black.

Object entry information: This single-cylinder pedestal engine was made by Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field for driving their collection of models at the International Exhibition of 1862. The cylinder is 4 1/4 in. diam. by 4.5 in. stroke, and is provided with a jacket through which the exhaust steam passes on its way to the condenser. The guides are cylindrical bars, and the main crankshaft bearings are carried by the pedestal. The steam is distributed by an ordinary slide-valve, driven by a single eccentric, which also works the feed pump. The condenser and hot- well are arranged in the base, within which is also a vertical air-pump driven by an additional crank in the crankshaft. The speed is regulated by a belt- driven Watt governor, carried on the top of the cylinder casing and control- ling the steam supply by a disc throttle-valve. The feed delivery pipe is fitted with a weighted relief valve, so that when the feed pipe of the boiler is closed the water pumped can return to the hot-well.

Object entry information: This compact form of engine (see No. 113) was re-invented by Mr. Bernays in 1874 with a simple and efficient valve gear, but built only to a limited extent; it has, however, since been used for both stationary and marine engines (see No. 125). The arrangement consists of two vertical cylinders, which may be compounded, placed side by side with the crankshaft above or between them. The piston-rod ends are connected by links with the ends of the base of a triangular frame, the apex of which embraces the crankpin, while the middle point of the base is guided in a straight line. The valve gear consists of a single eccentric, the strap of which has two connecting pins forming the corners of the base of a similar triangle which is controlled in the same way as the other triangle; each of the pins drives one valve. One of the designs shown is for a compound mill engine having cylinders 30 in. and 45 in. diam. by 50 in. stroke, to indicate 500 h.p. at 45 r.p.m. with a steam pressure of 50 lb. per sq. in. It has a Meyer expansion valve on the high-pressure cylinder, and the air-pump is driven by a lever from the middle of the triangle base. The other design represents a blowing engine having two steam cylinders 30 in. diam. and two air cylinders 72 in. diam., the common stroke being 70 in. The air cylinders are placed vertically below the steam cylinders and there is very little framework. In both designs crosshead guides are dispensed with on account of the small obliquity of the connecting-rod links.

The piston-rod ends are connected by links with the ends of the base of a triangular frame, the apex of which embraces the crankpin, while the middle point of the base is guided in a straight line. The valve gear consists of a single eccentric, the strap of which has two connecting pins forming the corners of the base of a similar triangle which is controlled in the same way as the other triangle; each of the pins drives one valve. One of the designs shown is for a compound mill engine having cylinders 30 in. and 45 in. diam. by 50 in. stroke, to indicate 500 h.p. at 45 r.p.m. with a steam pressure of 50 lb. per sq. in. It has a Meyer expansion valve on the high-pressure cylinder, and the air-pump is driven by a lever from the middle of the triangle base. The other design represents a blowing engine having two steam cylinders 30 in. diam. and two air cylinders 72 in. diam., the common stroke being 70 in. The air cylinders are placed vertically below the steam cylinders and there is very little framework. In both designs crosshead guides are dispensed with on account of the small obliquity of the connecting-rod links.

Object entry information: This is a small example of an engine differing only slightly from the preceding (Nos. 113 and 126). Two cylinders, arranged side by side, have a common connecting-rod in the form of a triangle, the apex of which encloses the pin of the overhanging crank. The two other corners of the triangle are, by very short links, connected respectively with the two piston-rods, the crossheads of which slide in ordinary guides. From the middle of the top of the triangle two bridle-rods couple the connecting-rod to a stationary centre on the side of the framing, and so restrict the movement and close the chain. The valves are in the form of cylindrical slides, and receive their motion from a common eccentric. The example has 3 in. cylinders, with 4 in. stroke, and is intended to run at 300 r.p.m., when it will indicate about 3 h.p.

Object entry information: This is a compact form of direct-acting engine in which a connecting-rod is dispensed with, the piston-rod being directly connected with the crankpin by a block sliding in a transverse slot formed in the crosshead. This arrangement is sometimes known as a ""dog-crank,"" and it has been much used for feed pumps. The cylinder is 4 in. diam. by 4.5 in. stroke, and is placed vertically on a bedplate which also serves as the bottom cover. The crosshead is very wide, above the cylinder in bearings cast on the top cover. The crosshead is very wide, and is formed of two gunmetal bars bolted together with distance pieces between their ends, the latter also acting as slipper blocks, which slide on two round guide bars rising from the bedplate and tied together at the top. A steel block, made in halves, embraces the crankpin and fits in the crosshead slot, so that as the crank revolves the block slides along the slot through a distance equal to the stroke of the crank. The arrangement allows the engine to be very short, but it introduces large bending stresses in the piston-rod, which is, therefore, made of large diameter. Mechanically the arrangement is equivalent to a connecting-rod of infinite length, and the piston has a simple harmonic motion. An ordinary slide-valve is used, operated by a disc crank on one end of the shaft, and a fly-wheel is mounted on the other end of the shaft.

The cylinder, which is 5 in. diam. by 7 in. stroke, is overhung and is finished externally by polished metal lagging covering the flanges as well as the usual non-conducting felt. The crank is formed with two counterbalanced discs, and there are also two fly-wheels, while the crankshaft has exceptionally long bearings ; the crank race is, moreover, enclosed by a cast-iron box, which retains any oil thrown off, and also carries the crankpin lubricator, these various arrangements being resorted to on account of the high speed employed. The slide valve is of the piston type, with the steam space in the middle, as was usual in the early long D valves ; it is driven, through a rocking shaft, by an eccentric of variable throw within one of the fly-wheels. The governor, which is arranged within this fly-wheel, consists of two heavy swinging levers pinned to opposite arms of the fly-wheel, and pulled inward by helical springs. When the levers swing outward, through centrifugal action, they turn the main eccentric and also an eccentric carrying it, moving them in opposite directions, so that the main eccentric is shifted along an approximately straight line, the cut-off being thereby altered while the lead remains nearly constant.

The engine is of the single-acting, two-stage expansion type with two high-pressure cylinders and two low-pressure ones, arranged with the high pressures above, and all acting on a two-throw crankshaft with the cranks 180 deg. apart. The guide or crosshead for the small end of each connecting rod is in the form of a trunk, working in a closed cylinder that acts as an air cushion ; by this arrangement, combined with single-acting cylinders, the pressures on the brasses of the crankpins and shaft are never reversed, so that slack bearings are permissible without any knock resulting, to which feature the high working speed found practicable is chiefly due. The steam distribution to each pair of tandem cylinders is effected by a long piston-valve, extending through a trunk which serves as the piston-rod of the two pistons whilst also acting internally as a valve by its passage through the

The engine is fitted with a governor gear that automatically adjusts the degree of expansion to the work being done. On the crankshaft are three eccentrics, but one of these is solely used for working the feed pump. The others drive the main slide-valve and the ""back cut-off"" or expansion-valve. The travel of the expansion-valve is determined by the position of a block in a rocking link, and this position is adjusted by the governor. When the governor rises it rotates the sheave of a small eccentric connected with it, and by this means moves the block along the link; as an eccentric is a non-reversible means of transmitting motion it is here introduced to prevent pressure from the link interfering with the action of the governor. The cylinder is 12.25 in. diam. by 22 in. stroke ; when the engine is supplied with steam at 60 lb. pressure and is making 95 r.p.m., it indicates 50 h.p. ; the same design was followed for engines with cylinders up to 22 in. diam. by 40 in. stroke indicating 185 h.p.

Object entry information: This is an example of a high-speed horizontal engine of American design. The cylinder, which is 5 in. diam. by 7 in. stroke, is overhung and is finished externally by polished metal lagging covering the flanges as well as the usual non-conducting felt. The crank is formed with two counterbalanced discs, and there are also two fly-wheels, while the crankshaft has exceptionally long bearings ; the crank race is, moreover, enclosed by a cast-iron box, which retains any oil thrown off, and also carries the crankpin lubricator, these various arrangements being resorted to on account of the high speed employed. The slide valve is of the piston type, with the steam space in the middle, as was usual in the early long D valves ; it is driven, through a rocking shaft, by an eccentric of variable throw within one of the fly-wheels. The governor, which is arranged within this fly-wheel, consists of two heavy swinging levers pinned to opposite arms of the fly-wheel, and pulled inward by helical springs. When the levers swing outward, through centrifugal action, they turn the main eccentric and also an eccentric carrying it, moving them in opposite directions, so that the main eccentric is shifted along an approximately straight line, the cut-off being thereby altered while the lead remains nearly constant.

Object entry information: This represents a single-acting, inverted, two-stage expansion engine for directly driving a large fan for mine ventilation (see Pumps Section), or other purposes. The engine was patented by Mr. N. Chandler in 1886-8, and subsequently improved; the two cylinders are arranged tandem fashion, with the high pressure above, so that there is a single piston-rod acting downward upon a crankshaft below, while the steam distribution is performed by two piston-valves similarly arranged and driven by a single eccentric. The cylinders are cast on a frame which contains guides for the piston and valve-rods, and the bearings for the crankshaft; it also forms a closed chamber in which the oil is retained and distributed over the bearings by the motion of the revolving parts, access to it being, however, obtainable by side doors.
A special feature of this engine is the construction of the ""sleeve"" at the lower end of the valve, by which, while permitting the passage of the exhaust steam through itself, the valve can close the exhaust port, thus giving comparatively quietly the momentum of the moving parts and assist them on their return stroke. The action of the steam in the engine is as follows:—Boiler steam is admitted above the high-pressure piston, which then makes a down stroke; in the next up stroke this steam is allowed to pass to the under side of the high-pressure piston and into a receiver, from which, in the next down stroke, it is admitted to the top side of the low-pressure piston; from this, at about the completion of this down stroke, it is discharged into the exhaust pipe, or condenser, with which the lower side of the piston is in communication, except when the cushioning at the end of the stroke is taking place.

Date of creation: 1885
Object entry information: metallic glands at the cylinder end; as the valve face is travelling with the piston, Mr. Willans in his patent of 1885 overcame the difficulty of steam distribution by forming his eccentric on the crankpin. The whole of the crank chamber is completely enclosed, to retain the oil which forms a bath at the lower portion of this space.
The speed is regulated by a spring-loaded centrifugal governor, fixed on the outer end of the crankshaft and adjustable by hand even while running. This governor moves an equilibrium piston-valve which controls the admission of steam, but before reaching it the steam has to pass through a separator which removes priming water and any solid impurities.

Maker/Donor: Mr. N. Chandler (patented by)
Date of creation: 1886-8 (patent date)
Object entry information: This represents a single-acting, inverted, two-stage expansion engine for directly driving a large fan for mine ventilation (see Pumps Section), or other purposes. The engine was patented by Mr. N. Chandler in 1886-8, and subsequently improved; the two cylinders are arranged tandem fashion, with the high pressure above, so that there is a single piston-rod acting downward upon a crankshaft below, while the steam distribution is performed by two piston-valves similarly arranged and driven by a single eccentric. The cylinders are cast on a frame which contains guides for the piston and valve-rods, and the bearings for the crankshaft; it also forms a closed chamber in which the oil is retained and distributed over the bearings by the motion of the revolving parts, access to it being, however, obtainable by side doors.
A special feature of this engine is the construction of the ""sleeve"" at the lower end of the valve, by which, while permitting the passage of the exhaust steam through itself, the valve can close the exhaust port, thus giving comparatively quietly the momentum of the moving parts and assist them on their return stroke. The action of the steam in the engine is as follows:—Boiler steam is admitted above the high-pressure piston, which then makes a down stroke; in the next up stroke this steam is allowed to pass to the under side of the high-pressure piston and into a receiver, from which, in the next down stroke, it is admitted to the top side of the low-pressure piston; from this, at about the completion of this down stroke, it is discharged into the exhaust pipe, or condenser, with which the lower side of the piston is in communication, except when the cushioning at the end of the stroke is taking place.

Object name: MODEL OF HORIZONTAL TANDEM COMPOUND ENGINE (working). (Scale 1: 12.)
Maker/Donor: Made by Adam Gilbert, Esq.
Date of creation: Received 1910.
Object entry information: This represents a very common type of compound condensing mill engine having the two cylinders arranged in line and the piston-rods driving a single overhung crank. The cylinders are mounted on one bedplate, and the front cylinder is connected with the main crankshaft bearing by a girder frame in which the bored crosshead guides are formed. The shaft carries a grooved fly-wheel; a crank disc is fixed to its front end and its rear end is supported on a separate pedestal bearing. The high-pressure cylinder is fitted with double-beat inlet-valves actuated by the variable expansion trip gear patented by Dr. W. R. Proell in 1881. In this arrangement, a horizontal lever, oscillated by an eccentric, has suspended at each end a bell-crank lever; the vertical arms of the bell-cranks have notches at their lower ends, which, in their downward motion, catch upon and depress the ends of short pivoted levers which are connected with the valve spindles. The motion of the rocking lever brings the horizontal arm of the bell-cranks periodically into contact with a horizontal plate, the position of which is controlled by the governor; this causes the notches to slip off the valve levers and allows the valves to close sharply under the action of springs and dash-pots mounted above them. If the speed increases the plate will rise and the valves will close earlier in the stroke. The exhaust-valves are of the “Corliss” type (see No. 135). The low-pressure cylinder has Corliss inlet and exhaust-valves, and the inlet valves have a hand adjusted trip gear of the modified “Reynolds” type. A wrist plate, loose on the valve spindle, carries a spring catch, which engages with an arm on the valve spindle; the wrist plate is oscillated by an eccentric and, at a certain point of the motion, the catch is disengaged from the valve arm by a fixed roller, so releasing the valve, which closes under the action of a spring and dash-pot. The positions of the releasing rollers are adjusted by hand. One eccentric serves for all the inlet-valves and another for the exhaust-valves.

Both of the valve motions represented were patented in 1859 by Mr. J. W. Hackworth, of Darlington; the details of that on the high-pressure cylinder were arranged by Mr. F. C. Marshall, while those of the low-pressure were devised by Mr. J. S. Raworth for an adjustable expansion arrangement only, reversal on electric lighting engines not being required. The Hackworth expansion and reversing gear consists of a single eccentric fixed to the shaft and opposite to the crank arm, from which the eccentric-rod proceeds in a direction approximately at right angles to the piston-rod. The end of the eccentric-rod is caused to move in a straight path, but one of adjustable inclination, while the valve-rod is attached to an intermediate point in the eccentric-rod. The motion directly derived from the eccentric gives the lead, which is constant, while that resulting from the sliding motion of the block in the inclined guide determines the cut-off and also the direction of running.

Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. T. & C. J. Coates, from drawings supplied by the Brush Electrical Engineering Co., and Messrs. R. & W. Hawthorn, Leslie & Co.,
Date of creation: 1898.
Object entry information: Plate IV., No. 2. In its general arrangements and details this model represents one of the two-stage expansion engines supplied by the Brush Co. to the City Road electric light station. The cylinders are 13.25 in. and 23.5 in. diam. respectively by 13.5 in. stroke, and are both steam jacketed. When supplied with steam at 100 lb. pressure and delivering into a surface condenser the engine indicates 300 h.p. at 240 r.p.m. The fly-wheel is 7.5 ft. effective diam. and has 10 grooves for 1.25 in. diam. rope, by which a dynamo is driven. The model deviates from the actual engine in that it does not show the second valve chest to the high-pressure cylinder, the valve of which is driven by an eccentric on the crankshaft controlled by a governor contained within a small fly-wheel. The high-pressure slide-valves are of the double ported piston type, while the low-pressure valve is of the D-slide class; all have vertical balance cylinders above them. The exhaust-valve of the high-pressure cylinder and the single valve of the low-pressure are actuated by the arrangement of valve gear shown in the low-pressure portion of the model. Both of the valve motions represented were patented in 1859 by Mr. J. W. Hackworth, of Darlington; the details of that on the high-pressure cylinder were arranged by Mr. F. C. Marshall, while those of the low-pressure were devised by Mr. J. S. Raworth for an adjustable expansion arrangement only, reversal on electric lighting engines not being required. The Hackworth expansion and reversing gear consists of a single eccentric fixed to the shaft and opposite to the crank arm, from which the eccentric-rod proceeds in a direction approximately at right angles to the piston-rod. The end of the eccentric-rod is caused to move in a straight path, but one of adjustable inclination, while the valve-rod is attached to an intermediate point in the eccentric-rod. The motion directly derived from the eccentric gives the lead, which is constant, while that resulting from the sliding motion of the block in the inclined guide determines the cut-off and also the direction of running.

Object name: MODEL OF UNDERTYPE ENGINE AND BOILER (working). (Scale 1: 8.)
Maker/Donor: Presented by W. L. Wightman, Esq.,
Date of creation: 1923.
Object entry information: This high-pressure two-stage expansion engine with boiler is a type that is self-contained, compact and only requires slight foundations, so that it is much used in factories, particularly abroad. The boiler is of the locomotive type arranged on a bedplate which at the fire-box end serves as a closed ashpit; at the front end the boiler rests on a saddle piece supported by a casting embodying the cylinder in one piece. The valves are of the ordinary locomotive type with eccentrics; usually the engine is not required to reverse, but if it were would be fitted with link motion. The governor is of the Hartnell high-speed type actuating a balanced piston-valve; there is an adjustment for altering slightly the normal speed. On the front of the high-pressure valve chest is an auxiliary valve to allow steam to pass direct to the low-pressure cylinder in order to be able to start in the event of the high-pressure crank stopping on a dead centre. The boiler feed pump is of the plunger type driven by an eccentric. At the scale given above the engine represents generally a maker's standard design having cylinders 8 in. and 14 in. diam. respectively by 16 in. stroke, which would develop at 140 lb. pressure and 135 r.p.m. 48 indicated h.p.

Maker/Donor: Presented by the Rev. Patrick Bell, LL.D.
Date of creation: 1868.
Object entry information: This engine shows one of the early attempts to obtain rotary motion from the pressure of steam without the intervention of a crank and connecting-rod; almost the same arrangement was proposed in 1838 by Lord Armstrong as a water motor, and an example subsequently constructed gave off 5 h.p. at 30 r.p.m., with an efficiency of 95 per cent. A metal disc is secured to a horizontal axis carried in bearings, and the lower half of the disc is enclosed by a chamber of circular section having its axis a semi-circle. One end of this chamber is closed and provided with a pipe through which steam enters, the exhaust taking place through the open end. The disc is provided with three holes, each fitted with a circular plate turning on an axis radial to the disc, and these plates when set at right angles to the disc become pistons in the lower enclosing chamber. Toothed gearing is arranged to rotate these pistons into the plane of the disc on leaving the cylinder and back again immediately after entering, locking levers retaining them in position during the intervals. The steam pressure upon these pistons forces the disc round, but the engine is non-expansive, and although some provision for packing has been made, the leakage must have been considerable and the wear and tear excessive.

Object name: MODEL OF A DISC ENGINE (working).
Maker/Donor: Presented by R. B. Prosser, Esq.
Date of creation: 1893.
Object entry information: The disc engine was patented by Messrs. E. and J. Dakeyne in 1830, and subsequently improved by Messrs. W. Taylor and H. Davies, besides others. In 1841 Messrs. Ransomes and Sims showed at Liverpool a Dakeyne rotary engine of 5 h.p., the first portable engine on wheels. It drove a thrashing machine and was rendered self-propelling by pitch chains from the crankshaft to the travelling axle. A similar engine was applied with some success by Messrs. G. and J. Rennie to drive a screw propeller (see Marine Engineering Collection); more recently the arrangement has been extensively used as a water meter. The chamber, which acts as a cylinder, is enclosed laterally by a spherical zone and endwise by a pair of cones whose apexes come together. The piston is a circular disc fitting the interior of the zone round its edge, and having at its centre a ball which forms the joint on which it gyrates. From the ball, and perpendicular to the disc, projects a rod whose further end is socketed in a crank arm attached to the shaft to be driven. There is a fixed radial partition in the cylinder, and a corresponding slot in the disc permits of the requisite motion. The disc and partition divide the chamber into four spaces, two of which are expanding while the other two are contracting; steam is admitted into the former and discharged from the latter by ports formed through the spherical wall of the partition, and the disc itself, by its motion over them, performs the function of a valve. The engine may be reversed by interchanging the inlet and exhaust passages.

Maker/Donor: Presented by R. B. Prosser, Esq.
Date of creation: 1893.
Object entry information: The disc engine was patented by Messrs. E. and J. Dakeyne in 1830, and subsequently improved by Messrs. W. Taylor and H. Davies, besides others. In 1841 Messrs. Ransomes and Sims showed at Liverpool a Dakeyne rotary engine of 5 h.p., the first portable engine on wheels. It drove a thrashing machine and was rendered self-propelling by pitch chains from the crankshaft to the travelling axle. A similar engine was applied with some success by Messrs. G. and J. Rennie to drive a screw propeller (see Marine Engineering Collection); more recently the arrangement has been extensively used as a water meter. The chamber, which acts as a cylinder, is enclosed laterally by a spherical zone and endwise by a pair of cones whose apexes come together. The piston is a circular disc fitting the interior of the zone round its edge, and having at its centre a ball which forms the joint on which it gyrates. From the ball, and perpendicular to the disc, projects a rod whose further end is socketed in a crank arm attached to the shaft to be driven. There is a fixed radial partition in the cylinder, and a corresponding slot in the disc permits of the requisite motion. The disc and partition divide the chamber into four spaces, two of which are expanding while the other two are contracting; steam is admitted into the former and discharged from the latter by ports formed through the spherical wall of the partition, and the disc itself, by its motion over them, performs the function of a valve. The engine may be reversed by interchanging the inlet and exhaust passages.

Object entry information: These wooden models represent the rotary engine patented by Joseph Maudsley in 1852; the same thing had, however, been patented by John Trotter in 1805. The engine consists essentially of a rotating cylindrical chamber, within which rotates a smaller cylindrical chamber placed eccentrically so as to touch the first. The inner chamber has a slot at one point, through which projects a radial partition fixed to the outer chamber; the crescent-shaped space between the two chambers is thus divided into two parts, one of which is expanding while the other is contracting, as the chambers revolve. Steam being admitted through a port in the outer chamber causes an unbalanced pressure upon the partition, the opposite side of which is connected with the exhaust by a port in the inner chamber, and so drives the chambers round. One model has the two chambers surrounded by a concentric casing to which the steam is admitted, the exhaust being through the axis. The other model is double and has three concentric rings with radial partitions between them, forming two chambers in which two eccentric rings rotate; no steam ports are shown on this model.

Object entry information: A complete 6 in. engine, together with a wooden model, are shown, which illustrate the mode of action of the engine patented by Mr. Beauchamp Tower in 1879, and now known as the “spherical” engine because the working chamber is a complete sphere. The mechanism is equivalent to a universal joint connecting two shafts inclined together at an angle of 135 deg. The cross-piece of the joint is filled in so as to form a circular piston, and the jaws or bows of the joint are filled in solid to the shape of a quarter of a sphere. The whole joint is enclosed in a spherical chamber, and it will be seen that the disc alternately approaches and recedes from the spherical segments to which it is attached, as the shafts rotate. Throughout each revolution there are two cavities simultaneously opening, and two closing—all four varying at the same mean rate, so that if steam is admitted into the enlarging cavities, and be permitted to exhaust from those that are closing, continuous rotation of the shafts is obtained. The rotation of the segments upon the surface of the sphere is utilised to distribute the steam—ports in the spherical surface being uncovered at the correct intervals by the moving segments. The chambers obtained in this engine are each equal to a quarter of the volume of the sphere, and in one revolution the total volume passed is equal to that of the sphere. As the only reciprocation is that due to the swing of the disc, the engine is suited for high speeds, and, for the power given off, is very compact.

Fielding, depends upon the oscillating motion which the cross of a universal joint has relative to the containing jaws when the system is rotated. Two shafts are set at an angle of 165 deg. to each other and connected by a Hooke’s joint; one serves as a pivot, the power being taken from the other. Four curved pistons are arranged on the cross-piece, two pointing towards one shaft and two towards the other, and on each shaft or jaw are formed two curved steam cylinders in which the curved pistons work. The steam enters and leaves the base of each cylinder through ports in the shaft, which forms a cylindrical valve working in the bearing as a seating.

Object entry information: These wooden models represent the rotary engine patented by Joseph Maudsley in 1852; the same thing had, however, been patented by John Trotter in 1805. The engine consists essentially of a rotating cylindrical chamber, within which rotates a smaller cylindrical chamber placed eccentrically so as to touch the first. The inner chamber has a slot at one point, through which projects a radial partition fixed to the outer chamber; the crescent-shaped space between the two chambers is thus divided into two parts, one of which is expanding while the other is contracting, as the chambers revolve. Steam being admitted through a port in the outer chamber causes an unbalanced pressure upon the partition, the opposite side of which is connected with the exhaust by a port in the inner chamber, and so drives the chambers round. One model has the two chambers surrounded by a concentric casing to which the steam is admitted, the exhaust being through the axis. The other model is double and has three concentric rings with radial partitions between them, forming two chambers in which two eccentric rings rotate; no steam ports are shown on this model.

Date of creation: 1885
Object entry information: This machine, patented in 1885 by Mr. A. Rigg, will be found to resemble in its movements an oscillating cylinder engine held by its crankshaft, and performing its cycle by the revolution of the framing round the crankshaft and the cylinder round the crankpin. The varying chamber of a recipro- cating engine is thus obtained, while the inertia stresses due to the recipro- cating parts are almost eliminated. The engine has three single-acting cylinders, the long plunger pistons of which act outwardly upon three crankpins, projecting from the face of an overhanging fly-wheel. The closed end of each cylinder is formed into an eye, and fits upon a stud or trunnion fixed to the engine-bed. This stud is not on the same centre-line as the fly-wheel shaft, so that in a complete revolution each piston makes a double stroke, of a length equal to twice this eccentricity. The driving stud acts on a sliding block so that the eccentricity can be varied and the stroke of the engine is rendered adjustable. The engine is reversed by sliding the stud into line with the fly-wheel shaft and continuing the sliding so as to give the eccentricity on the opposite side. The passage of the working fluid to and from the cylinders takes place through the faces of the eyes at the cylinder ends, which are provided with ports. The fluid enters and leaves the engine by the block carrying the stationary stud, the face of the block forming a surface on which the nearest cylinder end revolves, and acting as a disc slide-valve for the three cylinders. An adjacent sectional drawing shows clearly the details of this arrangement. The engine can be worked by steam, air, or water, but the full advantage resulting from the variable stroke is only obtained when working with water, owing to the cylinder clearance increasing as the stroke is reduced. The ordinary speed of these engines is from 100 to 500 r.p.m. with water pressure of 750 lb. per sq. in. When steam or compressed air is used, as many as 2,000 r.p.m. have been obtained.

Object entry information: This is a rotary steam engine of the form patented by Mr. J. F. Cooley in 1901, 1903, and 1907. Its construction depends upon the fact that if two ele- ments rotate in the same direction, about fixed centres, with a speed ratio of 3 : 2, then three points on the slower element, equidistant from its centre, will describe, relative to the faster element, one and the same two-lobed peritrochoidal curve known as a nephroid. If a piston of this form is made to revolve at the correct speed, in a suitably shaped revolving chamber, having the three describing points on it in contact with the piston, then the chamber will be divided into three expanding and contracting spaces which can be used as working cylinders. In the engine shown, the piston is mounted on a horizontal shaft and placed eccentrically inside a closed cylinder having a trefoil-shaped interior section with packing strips placed at the describing points. These strips, which have swivelling heads with two lines of contact, are the only parts in contact with the curved surface of the piston; they are held in contact by springs and have sufficient radial motion to render extreme accuracy of the piston form unnecessary. There are also other packing strips fitted in the cylinder ends and bearing against the flat ends of the piston. Pinions with 24 teeth are fitted to the shaft on each side of the piston, and these gear with internally toothed rings with 36 teeth fitted into holes in the cylinder end covers through which the shaft passes. Both cylinder and piston shaft run in roller bearings mounted in the end covers of an outer casing that surrounds the cylinder, and a ball thrust bearing is fitted to the tail end of the shaft. The cylinder has three longitudinal ports cut through it leading to the interior working spaces, and the casing, in which the inlet and exhaust passages are formed, fits closely round it.

Date of creation: 1884. Received 1890.
Object entry information: This is the original steam turbine, made in 1884. It worked for several years driving the dynamo which gave off 5 electrical h.p. The motor consists of a series of parallel-flow turbines on the same shaft, the first being the supply for the second, and so on. By this arrangement the efficient action of a steam turbine is greatly reduced.

To prevent vibration the bearings throughout are not quite rigidly fixed to the main castings, but are permitted a slight movement between clamping washers, the alternate washers fitting the casting and clearing the outside of the bearing, and *vice versa*.

In its course the oil passes through the hollow shaft of the dynamo so that it shall assist in cooling the armature and commutator. The governing is performed by a cylindrical throttle-valve actuated by a leather diaphragm, on one side of which the air pressure is reduced by a kind of fan attached to the main shaft. The exhausting action of the fan is partially neutralised by an iron arm turning on a vertical axis, by the attraction of the field magnet, drawn round, against the action of a spring, into a position that causes its extremity nearly to close the entrance to the air-pipe. By this arrangement the opening of the throttle-valve is regulated by the centrifugal action of the fan and by the intensity of the magnetic field, the control being partly mechanical and partly electrical. The dynamo has a drum armature, but, owing to the high speed employed, only a few convolutions are required, which, being of large section, give a very low internal resistance. The commutator is built up of short gunmetal segments insulated with asbestos and dove-tailed into steel rings. The machine is shunt wound.

Object entry information: This remarkable steam engine, invented and developed by Dr. C. Gustav P. de Laval, owes its success to the discovery by him, in 1889, of the fact that the velocity of the particles of an escaping jet of steam is increased by discharging through an expanding orifice, the conversion of the energy of the steam into momentum being so complete that, when applied to a form of Pelton wheel or impulse turbine (see No. 15), a high efficiency is obtained. Without the expanding orifice, a simple steam jet turbine is one of the earliest forms of steam engine (see No. 35), and very uneconomical, but by the use of many such turbines in series an efficient engine is also obtained (see No. 151).

The cylinder ends are made steam tight in the casing by cast-iron rings rotating with it and fitting between two non-rotating gunmetal rings, the outer one of which is adjusted by set-screws passing through the casing cover and pressing on a cast-iron backing ring. The longitudinal packings are pressed inward by springs and adjusted by external nuts. The bearings have short steel rollers of large diameter which are prevented from winding by closely-fitting side plates; the rollers run on hardened steel rings. Such engines could be made to reverse by providing the casing with two sets of inlet and exhaust ports, and suitable valves for bringing either set into use.

Object name: MODEL OF RATEAU STEAM TURBINE (working). (Scale 1: 4.)
Maker/Donor: Messrs. Fraser and Chalmers, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1908.
Object entry information: This model, which is partly sectioned, represents a steam turbine of the form patented by Prof. A. C. E. Rateau in 1896, and subsequently developed. It is arranged for direct connection with a dynamo having an output of 600 k.w. The turbine is of the compound or multi-stage impulse type, and consists of 14 simple turbines arranged in series in separate chambers, and with a common shaft. Each stage has a set of nozzles, in which the steam is expanded through a fraction of the total pressure drop, and a wheel which absorbs the kinetic energy thus generated; the steam enters at the high-pressure end of the series and passes successively through all the stages to the condenser. The steam velocity ranges from about 750 ft. per sec. at the first wheel to about 1,100 ft. per sec. at the last. The turbine is formed with a cylindrical casing of varying diameter, made in halves and divided by intermediate diaphragms into 14 chambers; this casing is closed and supported at each end by a cover, the upper half of which is separate, while the lower half forms part of a casting containing the shaft- bearing. The shaft is of large diameter at the middle, and is stepped towards each end to form the wheel seats; it is carried in a long fixed bearing at each end, the bushes being of cast iron, lined with white metal. A small thrust bearing is provided to keep the wheels in position and to take up any unbalanced axial pressure. The steam enters at the front of the central casing, through stop and regulating valves, and is led to the four first-stage nozzles that are fitted in the end cover. The nozzles for the succeeding stages are fitted into notches cut in the edges of the diaphragms, and they increase in circumferential length until at the exhaust end they occupy nearly the whole periphery. They are also placed in angular advance of one another so as to follow the helical course of the steam. The nozzles are built up of nickel steel plate for the first eight stages, and of brass for the other six. The first four wheels are single mild steel discs, riveted to flanges formed on hubs keyed to the shaft; the other ten wheels are formed of two slightly dished nickel steel discs, riveted one on each side of the hub flange, and also riveted together at the outer edge. The wheel blades are stamped from nickel steel plate and are of cylindrical shape with equal entrance and exit angles; they are formed with forked lower ends that are placed astride of the wheel discs and secured by two rivets. The outer ends are covered by a shrouding band secured by riveted projections on the blade ends; the steam entrance edges of the blades and nozzles are ground sharp. The wheels are balanced and tested before being placed in position. The diaphragms extend inward to the shaft, and are bushed with antifriction metal, which is grooved internally and fits closely over the wheel hubs. Where the shaft passes through the end covers stuffing-boxes are provided; these are double, and comprise an inner labyrinth packing formed with interlocking grooved bushes fitted to the shaft and cover, and running with small clearances; and an outer packing

Object name: WESTINGHOUSE STEAM TURBINE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by the British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1908.
Object entry information: This is a full-sized section showing the blading arrangement of a 4,000 k.w. steam turbine of the double-flow combined type patented by Mr. G. Westinghouse in 1902–5. The steam enters at the centre of the casing and flows towards both ends. It passes from an annular steam chest to a double set of nozzles in which the first expansion is carried out from the boiler pressure to about 45 lb. per sq. in.; it is then delivered on to the blades of a double impulse wheel, with intermediate guide blade, without further change of pressure. The remainder of the expansion is carried out by 20 pairs of fixed and rotating blades, of increasing length, of the ordinary Parsons form. This construction, while sacrificing some efficiency at the high-pressure end, considerably shortens the turbine, obviates the use of balance drums, enables a drum of uniform diameter to be used, and requires no high-pressure packing. The complete drum is about 56 in. diam. and is made of rolled weldless steel; it is mounted on three discs which are secured to a central shaft. The nozzles are formed of bent metal strips set in grooves in the sides of the circumferential slots which contain them. The high-pressure blades are made of drop-forged steel, formed with shroud pieces and dovetail roots which are set in slightly dovetailed grooves in the drum, and caulked tight with distance pieces in the usual manner; the longer ones are tied together, near their outer ends, by a wire of comma-shaped section passed through similar holes and with its tail turned over between the blades.

Object entry information: This model represents a design for a large turbo-alternator for an economical output of 10,000 k.w., with a steam consumption of 13 lb. per k.w. hour, but capable of being overloaded to 20,000 k.w. The turbine is of the ordinary Parsons type (see No. 151); the low-pressure end bearing is fixed to the alternator bedplate, while the high-pressure end is mounted on a separate one, upon which it can slide. The steam valves are mounted on the front of the lower half of the casing, so that the upper half may be removed without disturbing them. Oil is supplied to the bearings by a pump and returned to the oil-tank, which is placed under the turbine. The overload is provided for by a valve that admits high-pressure steam to an intermediate point along the turbine. The alternator is of the stationary armature type, and is entirely enclosed by a casing, through which a cooling current of air is forced. The exciting dynamo is mounted on the end of the bed.

Object entry information: This is a full-sized section showing the blading arrangement of a 4,000 k.w. steam turbine of the double-flow combined type patented by Mr. G. Westinghouse in 1902–5. The steam enters at the centre of the casing and flows towards both ends. It passes from an annular steam chest to a double set of nozzles in which the first expansion is carried out from the boiler pressure to about 45 lb. per sq. in.; it is then delivered on to the blades of a double impulse wheel, with intermediate guide blade, without further change of pressure. The remainder of the expansion is carried out by 20 pairs of fixed and rotating blades, of increasing length, of the ordinary Parsons form. This construction, while sacrificing some efficiency at the high-pressure end, considerably shortens the turbine, obviates the use of balance drums, enables a drum of uniform diameter to be used, and requires no high-pressure packing. The complete drum is about 56 in. diam. and is made of rolled weldless steel; it is mounted on three discs which are secured to a central shaft. The nozzles are formed of bent metal strips set in grooves in the sides of the circumferential slots which contain them. The high-pressure blades are made of drop-forged steel, formed with shroud pieces and dovetail roots which are set in slightly dovetailed grooves in the drum, and caulked tight with distance pieces in the usual manner; the longer ones are tied together, near their outer ends, by a wire of comma-shaped section passed through similar holes and with its tail turned over between the blades.

Object entry information: This model represents a design for a large turbo-alternator for an economical output of 10,000 k.w., with a steam consumption of 13 lb. per k.w. hour, but capable of being overloaded to 20,000 k.w. The turbine is of the ordinary Parsons type (see No. 151); the low-pressure end bearing is fixed to the alternator bedplate, while the high-pressure end is mounted on a separate one, upon which it can slide. The steam valves are mounted on the front of the lower half of the casing, so that the upper half may be removed without disturbing them. Oil is supplied to the bearings by a pump and returned to the oil-tank, which is placed under the turbine. The overload is provided for by a valve that admits high-pressure steam to an intermediate point along the turbine. The alternator is of the stationary armature type, and is entirely enclosed by a casing, through which a cooling current of air is forced. The exciting dynamo is mounted on the end of the bed.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. C. A. Parsons & Co.
Date of creation: 1912.
Object entry information: This drawing shows the internal construction of one of eight steam turbines which were built by Messrs. C. A. Parsons & Co., in 1909-10, for the Chelsea Power Station of the London Underground Electric Railways Co. at Lots Road (see adjacent prints). These large turbines are now made with two separate casings, each with its own shaft and rotor, the shafts being in line and connected together by a flexible claw coupling. This system enables each part of the turbine to have a short stiff shaft, reduces the size of the individual castings, and minimises the risk of distortion of the casings. The high-pressure portion has a solid steel shaft and drum with two diameters and 39 rows of moving blades; 50 per cent. overload is provided for by an automatic by-pass which admits steam at the thirteenth row of blades. The steam passes from the high-pressure casing, through a pipe, to the far end of the low-pressure casing, and flows through it in the reverse direction, exhausting at the centre of the machine. The low-pressure rotor is a parallel cylindrical drum mounted on two spiders on a solid shaft; it has 18 rows of moving blades, those in the last four rows being 12 in. long. Each shaft has its own thrust and adjusting block, and the bearings are of cast iron lined with white metal. The turbine is governed on the gust principle through a steam actuated relay, and there is a runaway valve that shuts off the steam if a certain speed is exceeded. The turbines run at 1,000 rev. per min., and, with steam at a pressure of 185 lb. per sq. in., a superheat of 140 deg. F., and a vacuum of 28 in., have shown a steam consumption, of 14 lb. per k.w. hour. The high-pressure part develops about 40 per cent. of the full power.

Object name: SECTIONAL DRAWING OF 500 K.W. COMBINED STEAM TURBINE. (Scale 1: 4.)
Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. C. A. Parsons & Co.
Date of creation: 1912.
Object entry information: This drawing shows the internal construction of the form of steam turbine in which the high-pressure steam is first expanded in nozzles and passed through a compound impulse wheel of the Curtis type (see No. 157) and then further expanded through a series of rows of blades of the ordinary Parsons reaction type. This form was introduced about 1902 (see No. 159), and is much favoured on the Continent; it reduces considerably the length of the machine, and relieves the main casing of the influence of very short high-pressure blades, and of the high pressure and temperature. The turbine has a solid forged steel rotor carrying 30 rows of reaction blading, while at the high-pressure end a large disc, which carries two rows of impulse blades, is bolted on. The nozzles are attached to a cast steel steam chest bolted to the main casing. The steam thrust is balanced by leading steam from the middle of the casing to the large end of the low-pressure drum. The shaft runs in brass bearings surrounded by sleeves fitted in cylindrical cast-iron housings, which are themselves mounted in the main bearing casings. A thrust and adjusting block is placed at the end of the shaft and is adjusted by sliding the bearing cap.

Maker/Donor: Lent by the Brush Electrical Engineering Co.
Date of creation: 1915.
Object entry information: These prints show improvements in the steam turbine patented by Mr. Birger Ljungström in 1906. His is a radial flow reaction turbine, but instead of a system of fixed and moving blades, both sets of blades revolve in opposite directions and power is taken off both shafts, consequently for the same relative speed, the shafts need only revolve at half the speed of the older systems. This idea was suggested in 1879 but it was reserved for Mr. Ljungström to overcome the mechanical difficulties involved.
The turbine consists of a series of concentric blade rings, mounted on two discs, each turbine rotor being fixed to short hollow extension shafts, so that each disc is overhung from the end of its alternator shaft. The blade rings interchange, the blades being set in opposite directions; the flow of the steam is reversed in direction.
Steam of high pressure and super-heat supplied through two vertical pipes enters the blade system at the centre and expands radially outwards. Between the inner and outer pair of discs by-pass steam is admitted to the blading for overloads. On entering from the last blade ring the steam passes through a diffuser comprising a number of converging channels in which the residual steam velocity is re-converted into pressure and the vacuum at the blade edges is thus slightly increased above that maintained in the condenser. Labyrinth packing prevents the escape of steam where the shafts pass through the side discs, and also up the back of the running discs. The axial pressure of the steam tending to force the blade discs apart, is balanced by the labyrinth discs. An essential feature of the design is the use of conical expansion rings of dumb-bell section between all connected parts subjected to temperature variations, enabling them to expand and contract freely without distortion.
In this machine there are 38 rows of blade rings (see No. 229). It is fitted with a centrifugal governor which is connected to the same vertical shaft which drives the geared pump supplying oil under pressure to the bearings. In each alternator shaft is an emergency governor adjusted to come into action at a speed approximately 10 per cent. above the running speed of the turbine.
The turbines of 1,000 k.w. run at 3,000 rev. per min. with a steam pressure of 162 lb. per sq. in. and a superheat of 310 deg. F. The steam consumption is 11.55 lb. per k.w. hour, or 8 lb. per brake h.p. hour. An efficiency of 73.6 per cent. is claimed.

The smaller beams have parallel top and bottom booms, with diagonal timber struts inclined at 60 deg.; in one case the tie bolts are inclined, and run axially through the timber struts, while in the other vertical iron tie bolts are used. In the latter case the model has been loaded to destruction. The two larger beams consist each of a lower timber beam with a built-up truss above, the chief difference between them being that in one all the members are in duplicate. They have gudgeons and hooks or staples attached by which their strengths could be experimentally determined. From their trussing it is evident that these beams were designed for single-acting engines.

Object entry information: These models were probably made by Watt when designing beams for his steam engines, as there is evidence that at first the engine beams gave trouble through their insufficient strength and rigidity. The smaller beams have parallel top and bottom booms, with diagonal timber struts inclined at 60 deg.; in one case the tie bolts are inclined, and run axially through the timber struts, while in the other vertical iron tie bolts are used. In the latter case the model has been loaded to destruction. The two larger beams consist each of a lower timber beam with a built-up truss above, the chief difference between them being that in one all the members are in duplicate.

Object entry information: who, it has been stated, obtained his information through one of Watt’s workmen; Watt, instead of contesting the patent, decided to adopt other mechanism. This and the four succeeding models show some of these mechanisms which he patented in 1781; of these, however, only the sun and planet gear came into use. It is an epicyclic gear consisting of a ""sun"" wheel keyed on the end of the fly-wheel shaft and a ""planet"" wheel bolted to the connecting-rod end and held in gear with the sun wheel by a link loose on their centres, as in the model, or by a pin in the centre of the planet wheel moving in an annular slot. When both wheels are of the same diameter the fly-wheel makes twice the number of revolutions that it would if actuated by a crank and connecting-rod, the extra revolution being due to the fact that the planet wheel, although going round in a circle, does not revolve on its own axis. In some of Watt’s engines the diameter of the planet wheel was less than that of the sun wheel, and in this way shaft speeds were obtained only about 50 per cent. greater than would have been the case with a simple crank.

The end of the connecting-rod is made in the form of a rack or ladder, the rungs of which are capable of acting on either side of a pinion fixed on the fly-wheel shaft of the engine. The connecting-rod is guided by a roller at the lower end, which works in a large opening of special form in a fixed guide plate which keeps the rack in gear with the pinion on the fly-wheel shaft. The arrangement somewhat resembles the mangle-wheel motion reversed.

The cranks are placed at 90 deg., and the steam is cut off before half stroke in the low-pressure cylinder so that a second charge of steam is not allowed to enter it in the middle of the stroke.

Maker/Donor: H. P. Holt, Esq.
Date of creation: 1878
Object entry information: This arrangement of valve, patented by Mr. Holt in 1878, combines in one fitting the drainage and relief safety valves for both ends of an engine cylinder. Pipes from the two ends enter the casing shown, and the discharged water from the cylinder is carried off by a central pipe. In the casing is a valve for each end of the cylinder, and each of these valves consists of a central disc or drain valve, and also of a double-seated annular valve outside, which is the relief valve; these annular valves are kept on their seats by springs. The action is such that, when steam is in one end of the cylinder, its pressure opens the drain valve of the other end or exhaust side, while, at any time, the central or relief portion of the valve will open should the pressure, through priming, exceed the limit determined by the springs.

Date of creation: 1857
Object entry information: This is a steam-jacketed vessel, commonly called “Cowper’s hot-pot,” for receiving the steam after it has been used and expanded in the high-pressure cylinder of a compound engine, and before it passes to the low-pressure cylinder: then, when the cranks have moved 90 deg., the steam passes out to the low-pressure cylinder, and in doing so is obliged to pass outside a lining and in close contact with the hot steam-jacketed vessel, thus becoming somewhat warmed up; it is then used and expanded in the low-pressure cylinder, thus allowing of a large amount of expansion and consequent economy. The cranks are placed at 90 deg., and the steam is cut off before half stroke in the low-pressure cylinder so that a second charge of steam is not allowed to enter it in the middle of the stroke. The receiver was first introduced in 1857, and the internal lining was added in 1862.

To prevent the passage of steam through the helical cut, a metal cover piece is fitted to the ring on each side. To expand this ring, both radially and endwise, a helical spring constructed somewhat like the external ring, but of smaller diameter, is prepared, and inserted within the true ring. A wooden model of a piston, fitted with this packing is shown, together with the internal and external portions of the packing for a larger piston of this kind. The packing is inserted by providing the piston with a junk ring held down by set screws, and an enclosing band tightened by a set screw has been provided for compressing the spring when the piston is being entered into the cylinder.

Object entry information: In this packing there are two split piston rings of L section, expanded radially, and separated longitudinally by about three turns of a single helical spring. The method of construction of this internal spring was patented in 1874 by Messrs. E. Wigzell, J. Pollit and W. Mellor, and consists in tapering a bar of spring steel towards the ends, winding it on a revolving mandrel, and tempering it in oil. A larger example of this spring is also shown, together with the clamp used to hold the rings while getting the piston into the cylinder.

Object entry information: This packing was patented in 1878 by Mr. W. Buckley. It consists of two equal steel rings, bored conically inside, and cut through at one spot, gunmetal cover pieces being fitted to prevent leakage between the ends of the rings. Between these rings is placed an internal ring, formed by coiling wire of rectangular section into a helix, flattening it, and joining the ends, after it has been bent to a circle by a flat core. This ring, pressing on the inclined interior surfaces of the split rings, expands them radially, and also forces them apart longi-tudinally, so as to maintain a tight joint on the sides of the recess in the piston, as well as on the cylinder.

Date of creation: 1893.
Object entry information: This packing is so designed that it may be placed in stuffing-boxes of ordinary construction, and be used to replace the fibrous packings so generally employed for piston and valve rods. It consists of a split cast-iron casing, turned to fit the stuffing-box freely, and provided internally with four deep grooves. In each groove are fitted two white metal rings cut through and breaking joint, the requisite elasticity for closing in being given by an encircling steel spring. In cases where packing cannot be slipped over the piston rod the white metal rings are formed in halves with overlapping joints, and the closing steel rings are also in halves, but dovetailed together. Rings for both arrangements are shown. The packing is held in place by the ordinary gland, an india-rubber washer being added at each end to give flexibility.

PXL_20251126_151706105.jpg,196,PISTON ROD PACKING.,Presented by the United States Metallic Packing Co.,1902,"This packing was patented in 1893 by Messrs. W. E. Plummer and W. M. Kermode, and is a development of a form invented by Mr. E. Monroe in 1875. Its features are that it permits of free lateral and angular motion of the rod due to vibration, it is self-adjusting under wear, and its contact round the rod is chiefly derived from the steam pressure.
In the arrangement shown by the sectional specimen the packing is of the duplex type, consisting of two separate sets of packing, the inner series partially resisting the steam pressure and the outer one completing the work.
The inner packing consists of three babbitt metal rings contained in a conical cup fitted with a gland which is forced home by springs assisted by the steam pressure. The front of the cup is free to slide on the plane face of a washer, the other face of which beds in a spherical recess on another washer, while the gland end is free to slide on the plane face of another washer which is forced home by a number of helical springs, but the chief closing pressure upon the gland is that exerted by the steam. With the exception of the soft metal rings the whole of these parts are bored much larger than the piston rod diameter.
The outer packing is similarly held endwise between flat and spherical faces kept in contact by springs assisted by the steam pressure, and so arranged as to give freedom for lateral and angular movement of the rod and its packing. The packing itself is, however, quite different, consisting of two rings each made up of gunmetal blocks and two blocks of babbitt metal, all forced inward by radial springs. The soft metal sectors break joint and also press upon the rod, while the gunmetal ones are quite clear of the rod; the reduced steam, moreover, which has passed the inner packing exerts a radial pressure upon these blocks which keeps them in closer contact with each other, and also presses the soft metal blocks upon the rod. Each babbitt metal block embraces one-third of the circumference of the rod, and as the four blocks break joint the complete circumference is thus fully covered.
It is claimed that, owing to the closing of the packing being automatically performed by the steam pressure, the arrangement works for many years without attention, and that wear is diminished owing to the pressure being relieved during the exhaust strokes.",Inv. 1902-149.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

The packing itself is, however, quite different, consisting of two rings each made up of gunmetal blocks and two blocks of babbitt metal, all forced inward by radial springs. The soft metal sectors break joint and also press upon the rod, while the gunmetal ones are quite clear of the rod; the reduced steam, moreover, which has passed the inner packing exerts a radial pressure upon these blocks which keeps them in closer contact with each other, and also presses the soft metal blocks upon the rod. Each babbitt metal block embraces one-third of the circumference of the rod, and as the four blocks break joint the complete circumference is thus fully covered.
It is claimed that, owing to the closing of the packing being automatically performed by the steam pressure, the arrangement works for many years without attention, and that wear is diminished owing to the pressure being relieved during the exhaust strokes.

Object entry information: Piston rod packing, of the form patented in 1899 by Mr. J. Walker is shown. The material is a fabric of asbestos interwoven with fine brass wire impregnated with india-rubber and vulcanized.
In the arrangement shown by the sectioned specimen (A) the packing consists of three V-grooved rings, and one circular ring moulded to suit the bevels of the neck bush and stuffing-box cover. Contact with the rod is ensured by steam pressure finding its way into the groove or channel, causing it to contract. The introduction of a double row of soft white metal studs offers a metallic bearing face which reduced the friction on the rod to a minimum.
The block metallic packing (B) is suitable to go under solid metal rings, and depends for its steam tightness on screwing up the glands; it is furnished with a triple row of white metal studs. The packing is supplied in spiral lengths of 10 feet or moulded into rings to suit the rod and box.
The steam hammer packing (C) is moulded with two flats to fit the rod, and to fit the unequal packing space. It can be fitted or removed from the gland without moving the hammer head.
The automatic hydraulic packing (D) is suitable for pump or hydraulic work; watertightness is ensured by the pressure acting on the lips of the packing rings.

Maker/Donor: Presented by the United States Metallic Packing Co.
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This packing was patented in 1893 by Messrs. W. E. Plummer and W. M. Kermode, and is a development of a form invented by Mr. E. Monroe in 1875. Its features are that it permits of free lateral and angular motion of the rod due to vibration, it is self-adjusting under wear, and its contact round the rod is chiefly derived from the steam pressure.
In the arrangement shown by the sectional specimen the packing is of the duplex type, consisting of two separate sets of packing, the inner series partially resisting the steam pressure and the outer one completing the work.
The inner packing consists of three babbitt metal rings contained in a conical cup fitted with a gland which is forced home by springs assisted by the steam pressure. The front of the cup is free to slide on the plane face of a washer, the other face of which beds in a spherical recess on another washer, while the gland end is free to slide on the plane face of another washer which is forced home by a number of helical springs, but the chief closing pressure upon the gland is that exerted by the steam. With the exception of the soft metal rings the whole of these parts are bored much larger than the piston rod diameter.
The outer packing is similarly held endwise between flat and spherical faces kept in contact by springs assisted by the steam pressure, and so arranged as to give freedom for lateral and angular movement of the rod and its packing. The packing itself is, however, quite different, consisting of two rings each made up of gunmetal blocks and two blocks of babbitt metal, all forced inward by radial springs.

Object entry information: This model represents the packing fitted to the high-pressure piston rods of H.M.S. “Hampshire,” and is of the form patented by Mr. J. M. Robson in 1903. The packing is of the duplex type, consisting of two separate sets of packing, the inner set being contained in the stuffing-box, and the outer one in an extension cap bolted on. The inner packing consists of white metal wearing rings, composed of a special alloy, made in segments and fitted within gun-metal cases or cups, the lips of which telescope into one another. These cups have bevelled surfaces which bear upon corresponding surfaces on the packing rings, so that when axial pressure is applied to the cups by a number of helical springs placed at the inner end of the stuffing-box, the packing is closed on to the rod with sufficient pressure to prevent leakage but not to cause undue friction. The cups are smaller in diameter than the inside of the stuffing-box, and they fit between flat surfaces so that lateral motion of the rod and packing is allowed. The outer packing consists of two floating segmental wearing rings held endwise by springs, between flat plates, while radial pressure is applied by surrounding split rings, the free ends of which are drawn together by flattened helical springs. Lubricating oil is supplied to the space between the two packings.

Object entry information: These are examples of the S.E.A. piston rod packing rings patented by Mr. A. R. Trist from 1903 to 1907. They are designed for use with steam or water, and are kept tight by the internal pressure for their steam-tightness, the piston rod moves through them with a minimum of friction. The rings are made of a composite laminated material consisting of alternate layers of textile fabric and rubber, vulcanised together and coated with graphite. They are formed with a thick heel and a tapering lip, which is bent inwards and downwards. The rings are placed one on the other in the stuffing-box with the lip turned in the direction of the pressure, their ends being butted closely together ; header rings of solid packing are placed at the top and bottom, the bottom header ring having an open joint to permit the fluid to pass to the rings. The wide heel of one ring rests on the curved top of the next lower ring, and the inner edge of the heel is made of harder material to prevent it from spreading and filling the arch of the ring, it being essential that the lip of the ring should be free. The gland is screwed up only sufficiently hard to hold the rings tightly together. Experiments have shown that the friction of these rings, when perfectly steamtight, is only about 40 per cent. of that of plain rings. The packings are made in a range of sizes for rods from 0.875 in. to 8 in. diam., and in several widths for each diameter. They are also made with a basis of asbestos, cotton or flax. The examples shown are for a rod 2.5 in. diam., and they have a width of 0.75 in.

As a sliding valve may continue its movement after it has closed any particular passage which it controls, it may be so arranged as to open or close other passages, simultaneously or otherwise, and thus combine the duties of several valves. Owing to this feature a single slide valve replaced the four beat valves which were originally necessary in the early double-acting steam engines, and this simplicity, combined with quietness in working, has since led to the general adoption of the slide valve in nearly all classes of steam engines. The valves illustrated are:—long D, short D, common or locomotive, piston, double-ported, Trick’s, Church’s and Hackworth’s, detailed descriptions of which will be found attached.

Object entry information: In order to adjust the work done in steam engine cylinders to suit the variations in the load, two methods are practicable; the first and simplest is to reduce the pressure in the steam chest, by throttling, when the load is below its maximum amount; the second and more economical method is to alter the fraction of the stroke during which steam is being admitted, and leave the completion of the stroke to be performed by this steam while expanding. For involving some form of valve arranged on the back of the main valve and so working many devices have been employed, usually actuated by adjustable gearing as to cut off the steam on its way to the main valve.

One of these guides is made self-adjusting by springs, so as to keep the surfaces in contact, since, owing to there being no surrounding steam chest, the only pressure keeping the valve to its face is that due to the action of the steam upon the difference between the internal back and front areas. One model shows a cylinder fitted with this valve, while the other, together with a drawing, represents a pair of these valves in the chest of an inside cylinder locomotive in which, however, there would be no steam pressure.

Object entry information: This arrangement of steam engine valves, for reducing cylinder clearance to a minimum, was patented by Mr. W. McNaught in 1908. There are four separate piston valves arranged at right angles to the axis of the cylinder and working in perforated liners fitted across the steam and exhaust passages, which are cast along the top and bottom of the cylinder. When the valves are moved outward they uncover the perforations and allow the steam to enter or leave the cylinder. The piston, which is made longer than usual, is allowed to approach as nearly as possible to the cylinder covers, and the valves have conical inner ends which project between the cylinder wall and the cylinder covers. Holes are drilled through the valves to balance the steam pressure on their ends. The inlet valves are fitted with dash-pots and are arranged to be operated by a trip gear; the exhaust valves may be worked by any ordinary gear.

Object entry information: The engine represented is fitted with a modification, patented by Mr. W. Inglis in 1863, of the Corliss valve gear originally brought out in 1848. The valves are operated by “wrist plates” rocked by eccentrics on a countershaft connected with the crankshaft, but the closing of the steam valves is effected, when released or tripped, by helical springs in small air dash-pots. The period of release is determined by a high-speed governor, assisted by a supplementary one patented by Mr. W. Knowles in 1883, its function being to vary the length of the rod from the main governor to the trip gear, and so remove the slight change of speed that had caused the main governor to alter its height. The engine is of the tandem two-stage expansion type, with cylinders 32 and 54 in. diam. by 6 ft. stroke; under steam at 85 lb. pressure, it makes 51 rev. per min. and indicates 1,200 h.p.

Object entry information: This represents the form of slide valve and operating gear patented by Mr. Silver in 1864. The valve is elongated and has portions of its ends cut away so that the port area for steam admission is restricted, while the whole area is available for exhaust. Motion is given to the valve by a disc oscillated by an eccentric, the point of attachment of the valve rod being adjustable so that variable expansion and reversing are obtainable. Adjustment is effected by attaching the valve rod to the middle point of a link which slides upon two pins fixed in the face of the disc; and a rack is formed on the back of the link and this gears with a pinion which is rotated by a worm and worm wheel.

Object name: MOTION DIAGRAM OF HOLT'S REVERSING GEAR.
Maker/Donor: Lent by H. P. Holt, Esq.,
Date of creation: 1879.
Object entry information: This auxiliary steam reversing gear was patented by Mr. Holt in 1876. The reversing piston has its motion controlled by a three-ported slide valve connected with the reversing lever, but also receiving motion from this piston.

The valves are operated by “wrist plates” rocked by eccentrics on a countershaft connected with the crankshaft, but the closing of the steam valves is effected, when released or tripped, by helical springs in small air dash-pots. The period of release is determined by a high-speed governor, assisted by a supplementary one patented by Mr. W. Knowles in 1883, its function being to vary the length of the rod from the main governor to the trip gear, and so remove the slight change of speed that had caused the main governor to alter its height. The engine is of the tandem two-stage expansion type, with cylinders 32 and 54 in. diam. by 6 ft. stroke; under steam at 85 lb. pressure, it makes 51 rev. per min. and indicates 1,200 h.p.

Object name: MOTION DIAGRAM OF JOY'S RADIAL VALVE GEAR. (working).
Maker/Donor: Presented by David Joy, Esq., 1900.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: In this gear (see No. 213) the valve rod is attached to the short end of a long lever, the other end of which is indirectly coupled to the engine connecting rod. The fulcrum of this lever is fitted with a block sliding in a curved guide, and the engine is reversed or “linked-up” by altering the angle that this guide makes with the valve rod. The guide is shaped to a circular arc of a radius equal to the length of the valve rod, and the block, when the engine is running, works equally on both sides of the centre of this guide. As the crankshaft rotates, any point on the connecting rod has a nearly elliptical path, which would give an unequal distribution of the steam at the two ends of the cylinder if the long lever were retained at the one connecting rod. To avoid this objection the motion is obtained from a link, one end of which is attached to the connecting rod and the other to a radius rod. A point in this link describes an oval path, which gives a symmetrical motion to the slide valve. It is stated that, in mid-gear, steam is admitted into the cylinder to the extent of the lead at each end, and that the lead is constant for all positions, while unequal lead can be arranged for, if preferred. A valuable feature of this gear is that it readily brings the valve chest into a position at right angles to that usually occupied. For the sliding block and a curved guide, a swinging lever is sometimes substituted, the inclination of the curved path or the inclination of the swinging lever being altered by changing the position of the stationary end of the lever. Photographs of several varieties of engines so fitted will be found in the collection.

Object entry information: In this gear, designed by Dr. W. R. Proell, and patented in 1881, a double beat valve is used as an expansion valve. The opening is caused by an eccentric, through the medium of a rocking lever and bellcrank; the closing, when released, is done by a spring. The releasing is performed by a trip motion, the time of which is controlled by the position of the governor. In the model there are two bellcranks, mounted on a rocking lever which is oscillated by an eccentric. The vertical arms of the bellcranks, alternately in their downward motion, lift the valve; the horizontal arms, by which the tripping is effected, are under the control of the governor.

Object entry information: This radial valve gear without eccentrics was patented in 1882 by Mr. A. Morton; it is shown fitted to a vertical marine engine. A radius rod, controls the free end of a lever, which receives a compound motion from the connecting rod and the cross-head. From a point in this lever a rod extends to a pin in a curved slot, rigidly attached to the slide valve; the position of the pin in this slot determines whether the engine is in forward or backward gear, and also the grade of expansion. The rod from which the valve is directly operated describes a nearly elliptical path, with the major axis horizontal, and so gives a very uniform distribution at both ends of the cylinder.

The fulcrum of this lever is fitted with a block sliding in a curved guide, and the engine is reversed or “linked-up” by altering the angle that this guide makes with the valve rod. The guide is shaped to a circular arc of a radius equal to the length of the valve rod, and the block, when the engine is running, works equally on both sides of the centre of this guide. As the crankshaft rotates, any point on the connecting rod has a nearly elliptical path, which would give an unequal distribution of the steam at the two ends of the cylinder if the long lever were retained at the one connecting rod. To avoid this objection the motion is obtained from a link, one end of which is attached to the connecting rod and the other to a radius rod. A point in this link describes an oval path, which gives a symmetrical motion to the slide valve. It is stated that, in mid-gear, steam is admitted into the cylinder to the extent of the lead at each end, and that the lead is constant for all positions, while unequal lead can be arranged for, if preferred. A valuable feature of this gear is that it readily brings the valve chest into a position at right angles to that usually occupied. For the sliding block and a curved guide, a swinging lever is sometimes substituted, the inclination of the curved path or the inclination of the swinging lever being altered by changing the position of the stationary end of the lever.

Object entry information: In this gear, designed by Dr. W. R. Proell, and patented in 1881, a double beat valve is used as an expansion valve. The opening is caused by an eccentric, through the medium of a rocking lever and bellcrank; the closing, when released, is done by a spring. The releasing is performed by a trip motion, the time of which is controlled by the position of the governor. In the model there are two bellcranks, mounted on a rocking lever which is oscillated by an eccentric. The vertical arms of the bellcranks, alternately in their downward motion, lift the valve; the horizontal arms, by which the tripping is effected, are under the control of the governor.

A radius rod, controls the free end of a lever, which receives a compound motion from the connecting rod and the cross-head. From a point in this lever a rod extends to a pin in a curved slot, rigidly attached to the slide valve; the position of the pin in this slot determines whether the engine is in forward or backward gear, and also the grade of expansion. The rod from which the valve is directly operated describes a nearly elliptical path, with the major axis horizontal, and so gives a very uniform distribution at both ends of the cylinder.

Object entry information: In this valve gear, patented in 1885 by Mr. J. Wheelock, the cylinder has separate steam and exhaust valves at both ends, all in the form of wide gridiron slides. The seats for these are formed on skeleton plugs secured into long, slightly conical holes, which are bored transversely to the cylinder. At the back of each slide is a short crank arm connected with the slide by a link, and these cranks are rocked from a single eccentric on the engine shaft. The steam admission valves each have their crank rocked by a latch lever connected with the external mechanism of the exhaust valve, but when the lever is lifted suddenly by a spring or weight checked by a dash-pot. The instant when the latch lever disengages is automatically determined by a cam lever controlled by the engine governor, so that any increase in the speed will cause the cut-off to take place earlier in the stroke. The introduction of the short cranks at the backs of the slides causes the exhaust valves to remain fully open for a longer time than would otherwise be the case, while with the steam valves considerable variation in the action of the dash-pots is possible without its causing any imperfect closing of the steam ports. In recent engines double grid valves and seats are adopted for high pressures.

Object entry information: This valve gear, patented in 1882 and 1884, by Mr. C. J. Galloway and Mr. J. H. Beckwith, is intended for use in an engine having an independent exhaust valve and two separate steam valves driven by separate eccentrics. The diagram shows the eccentric and gear for one of the steam valves. The slide valve rod is moved a certain distance from the eccentric until a catch liberates the valve rod, when it shoots back to the closed position under the action of a spring or piston, a dash-pot being added to stop the valve quietly after the port has been covered. The proportion of the piston stroke that is performed before the catch is liberated is determined by the engine governor. The motion from the eccentric is transmitted to the valve rod by a short horizontal lever, which when slightly lowered, catches a projection on the valve rod. The lever has a roller connected with it rolling on a fixed incline, the amount that the roller is below the lever being determined by the speed of the governor, so that the distance rolled up the incline before the lever is lifted high enough to release the valve rod and so cut off the steam, is automatically controlled. A photograph of an engine so fitted is also shown.

Object name: MOTION DIAGRAM OF AUTOMATIC EXPANSION GEAR.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. H. & T. C. Batchelor.
Date of creation: 1889.
Object entry information: In this valve gear, patented in 1885 by Mr. J. Wheelock, the cylinder has separate steam and exhaust valves at both ends, all in the form of wide gridiron slides. The seats for these are formed on skeleton plugs secured into long, slightly conical holes, which are bored transversely to the cylinder. At the back of each slide is a short crank arm connected with the slide by a link, and these cranks are rocked from a single eccentric on the engine shaft. The steam admission valves each have their crank rocked by a latch lever connected with the external mechanism of the exhaust valve, but when the lever is lifted suddenly by a spring or weight checked by a dash-pot. The instant when the latch lever disengages is automatically determined by a cam lever controlled by the engine governor, so that any increase in the speed will cause the cut-off to take place earlier in the stroke. The introduction of the short cranks at the backs of the slides causes the exhaust valves to remain fully open for a longer time than would otherwise be the case, while with the steam valves considerable variation in the action of the dash-pots is possible without its causing any imperfect closing of the steam ports. In recent engines double grid valves and seats are adopted for high pressures.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Holborow & Co.
Date of creation: 1886.
Object entry information: This represents a horizontal engine fitted with the valve gear patented in 1885 by Mr. H. G. Holborow. In the steam chest is a main slide valve, worked by a single eccentric, and on its back is a gridiron cut-off plate worked by another eccentric; the motion of this cut-off valve is controlled by a Porter governor in such a way that the proportion of the stroke done under full steam is decreased upon there being any increase in the speed of the engine. The expansion eccentric rocks a link, one end of which is carried by a pin moving with the main valve, and the cut-off valve rod has also a slotted link; into these two slots passes a block connected with the governor, which, by altering the position of the block, determines the amount of relative motion which the back plate receives from its eccentric and thus determines the point of cut-off; the opening and closing of the main slide valve, remain unaltered.

Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. C. A. Parsons & Co.
Date of creation: 1909.
Object entry information: In the first Parsons turbine (see No. 151) the blades were straight, and were milled out of solid rings, which were afterwards fitted to the spindle and casing. Later on they were still of uniform thickness and milled in solid rings, but their shape was improved by bending them. In 1896, however, the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons patented the present form of blade and the method of fixing them in plain or serrated grooves cut in the drum and casing. The blades are made of drawn brass and have indentations formed across their lower ends; they are cut to length and inserted in the grooves with correctly shaped distance pieces between them, which are then expanded by caulking tools so as to grip the blades and the sides of the grooves. One or more notches are cut in the edge of each long blade, and lacing strips are soldered into them so as to increase the rigidity of the blades. The tips are thinned down in the manner patented by the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons and Mr. G. G. Stoney in 1905, so that, should the blades touch the casing, the tips simply wear down. In this way radial clearance may be reduced to a minimum without danger of stripping.
In order to assemble the turbines more rapidly, the blades, instead of being put in singly, are now made up into segments, consisting of a number of blades fastened together, and these are afterwards caulked into the grooves. Two methods of doing this are shown; in one, patented by the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons, Mr. G. G. Stoney, and Mr. D. F. Fullagar in 1899, and illustrated by a casing segment of 5.5 in. double-laced blades, the blades are set in notches milled along the side of a root strip, the metal between the notches being bent over so as to grip the blades, and the projecting corners afterwards levelled off; the whole is then bent to the required curvature. The grooves for this method have to be wider than the blades. The other, known as the “rosary” method, consists in threading the blades and distance pieces on a wire, and building them up on a former into complete segments with the lacing strips attached; this is shown by a rotor segment of 3 in. blades with a single lacing strip.
Specimens are also shown of separate 3 in. and 5.5 in. blades of the rosary type, together with their corresponding caulking sections and lacing strips.

Object name: BLADING DETAILS FOR PARSONS STEAM TURBINES.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. C. A. Parsons & Co.
Date of creation: 1909.
Object entry information: In the first Parsons turbine (see No. 151) the blades were straight, and were milled out of solid rings, which were afterwards fitted to the spindle and casing. Later on they were still of uniform thickness and milled in solid rings, but their shape was improved by bending them. In 1896, however, the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons patented the present form of blade and the method of fixing them in plain or serrated grooves cut in the drum and casing. The blades are made of drawn brass and have indentations formed across their lower ends; they are cut to length and inserted in the grooves with correctly shaped distance pieces between them, which are then expanded by caulking tools so as to grip the blades and the sides of the grooves. One or more notches are cut in the edge of each long blade, and lacing strips are soldered into them so as to increase the rigidity of the blades. The tips are thinned down in the manner patented by the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons and Mr. G. G. Stoney in 1905, so that, should the blades touch the casing, the tips simply wear down. In this way radial clearance may be reduced to a minimum without danger of stripping.
In order to assemble the turbines more rapidly, the blades, instead of being put in singly, are now made up into segments, consisting of a number of blades fastened together, and these are afterwards caulked into the grooves. Two methods of doing this are shown; in one, patented by the Hon. Sir Charles A. Parsons, Mr. G. G. Stoney, and Mr. D. F. Fullagar in 1899, and illustrated by a casing segment of 5.5 in. double-laced blades, the blades are set in notches milled along the side of a root strip, the metal between the notches being bent over so as to grip the blades, and the projecting corners afterwards levelled off; the whole is then bent to the required curvature. The grooves for this method have to be wider than the blades. The other, known as the “rosary” method, consists in threading the blades and distance pieces on a wire, and building them up on a former into complete segments with the lacing strips attached; this is shown by a rotor segment of 3 in. blades with a single lacing strip.

Object entry information: This shows the hydraulic governor used for “tripping” the valve gear of a Cornish pumping engine, and by which the number of strokes per minute can be adjusted to the work to be done, owing to the alteration it permits in the interval of rest at the completion of each double stroke. In many engines, however, there are two cataract governors, so that there is a period of rest at the end of each stroke during which the pump valves return to their seats. The arrangement consists of a weighted plunger in a vertical cylinder arranged in a water cistern, from which, when the plunger is raised, water enters the cylinder through a non-return valve; upon the plunger being released it descends at a rate determined by the amount by which a valve at the side of the cylinder is opened. The plunger is raised by a lever moved by a tappet on the plug rod of the engine valve gear, and the subsequent descent of the plunger lifts the catches, and so releases the valve that controls the next stroke of the engine. A complete cataract valve gear is shown in action on the Cornish pumping engine (see Pumps Section).

Object entry information: This is a very simple form of governor, patented by Mr. Benjamin Hick in 1840, for controlling the throttle valve of a steam engine, and depending for its operation upon the resistance offered by the air to the rotation of a fan. The boss of the fan is a nut working on a quick-threaded screw cut on a vertical spindle driven by the engine. The resistance of the air retards the fan, and its nut mounts the thread of the screw when the speed of the spindle increases. This motion partly closes the throttle valve.

The plunger is raised by a lever moved by a tappet on the plug rod of the engine valve gear, and the subsequent descent of the plunger lifts the catches, and so releases the valve that controls the next stroke of the engine.

The sleeve is connected with the throttle valve by levers and rods. This, and other forms of governors running at high speeds, can be made as sensitive as desired, and are more powerful than the older forms, having large balls running at low speeds (see Nos. 73 and 75).

The resistance to the rotation of the governor is provided by a dash-pot or revolving vessel containing water. This vessel is provided with internal vanes, which carry the water round, and dash it against other vanes, within the vessel but mounted on a vertical spindle, which is prevented from rotating by a spring balance with index and dial. When the speed is increased, the work done in agitating the water is increased, and the pressure exerted by it against the shaft vanes turns the vertical shaft through a portion of the revolution, at the same time indicating the speed on a scale on the dial. The action is elucidated by an adjacent diagram.

Object entry information: This form of throttle valve governor was patented by Mr. Silver in 1855–7. It has crossed arms with balls on the end of each, the action of gravity being thereby neutralised, so that the governor can be used in any position as at sea. When the balls fly outward under centrifugal action, they are assisted by a spring connected with the sleeve working the throttle valve.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Ormerod, Grierson & Co., 1887.
Date of creation: 1887
Object entry information: This is a form of high-speed steam engine governor, designed by Mr. C. T. Porter about 1858, and used very largely for stationary engines. The governor has a pair of arms pivoted at the top of a rotating spindle, and carrying small balls at their lower ends; two links connect the balls to a sliding sleeve, and this is loaded with a large central weight which tends to pull down the balls without increasing their centrifugal action. The sleeve is connected with the throttle valve by levers and rods. This, and other forms of governors running at high speeds, can be made as sensitive as desired, and are more powerful than the older forms, having large balls running at low speeds (see Nos. 73 and 75).

Object entry information: This governor, patented in 1861 by Mr. J. Standfield, involves the same principle of intermediate bevel wheels as does that of Siemens, No. 233, and will be more readily understood by reference to the latter; in this case, however, there is also a dial for indicating varying speeds, and the resistance against the carrying round of the intermediate bevel wheels and the consequent shutting of the throttle valve, is provided by an adjustable coiled spring. The resistance to the rotation of the governor is provided by a dash-pot or revolving vessel containing water. This vessel is provided with internal vanes, which carry the water round, and dash it against other vanes, within the vessel but mounted on a vertical spindle, which is prevented from rotating by a spring balance with index and dial. When the speed is increased, the work done in agitating the water is increased, and the pressure exerted by it against the shaft vanes turns the vertical shaft through a portion of the revolution, at the same time indicating the speed on a scale on the dial. The action is elucidated by an adjacent diagram.

Object entry information: This construction of governor was patented in 1870 by Mr. John Bourne. It consists of a thin hollow brass spheroid divided by axial cuts into a number of flexible bars or ribbons. When rotated at a high speed, the centrifugal action causes the spheroid to increase in transverse diameter and diminish in length. This change gives motion to a collar which is connected with the throttle valve; there is an axial screw fitted with a wing nut by which the action of the governor can be varied.

The governor has a cylindrical chamber with a central diaphragm, one half forming an oil reservoir and the other the pump chamber. The oil enters the pump at the centre from the reservoir, and passes into a vertical cylinder cast on one side of the chamber. The piston is an easy fit in the cylinder, so that a small quantity of oil leaks past it, and is returned to the reservoir. The piston rod passes through a stuffing-box, and is connected with the weighted arm of a pivoted lever, the opposite arm of which is attached to the spindle of a rotating throttle valve. The speed is regulated by varying the position of the weight on the lever. The pump spindle runs in bearings in the chamber ends, and one end passes through a stuffing-box, and has the driving pulley fixed to it.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Schäffer and Budenberg, 1888.
Date of creation: 1888
Object entry information: This is a steam engine governor of the form patented by Mr. E. Buss in 1876. The mechanism is mounted on a fixed vertical spindle projecting from a casing containing a cylindrical throttle valve. A long gunmetal sleeve fits over this spindle, which is suspended by a steel screw at the top and rotated by bevel gearing at the lower end; near the top of the sleeve lugs are formed, and below these a collar. A hollow spherical casing surrounds the sleeve and is free to slide vertically; this casing has formed within it supports for the axes of four double-armed pendulums, the longer vertical arms of which project through the casing and carry balls at their lower ends, while the shorter horizontal arms turn towards the spindle and are connected with the sleeve lugs by short links. A helical spring is placed between the sleeve collar and the bottom of the casing. A rod is connected at one end with the lower part of the casing and at its lower end to a crank fixed on the valve spindle. When the engine shaft rotates above the normal speed, the balls fly outward and they, together with the casing, move upward compressing the spring; this movement acts upon the valve and so reduces the supply of steam. This form of governor can be made as sensitive as desired, and, while being compact, has a considerable motion between its extreme positions; the whole of its working parts, except the sleeve, are utilised in producing the controlling force.

Object entry information: This is a steam engine governor of the form patented by Mr. E. Buss in 1876. The mechanism is mounted on a fixed vertical spindle projecting from a casing containing a cylindrical throttle valve. A long gunmetal sleeve fits over this spindle, which is suspended by a steel screw at the top and rotated by bevel gearing at the lower end; near the top of the sleeve lugs are formed, and below these a collar. A hollow spherical casing surrounds the sleeve and is free to slide vertically; this casing has formed within it supports for the axes of four double-armed pendulums, the longer vertical arms of which project through the casing and carry balls at their lower ends, while the shorter horizontal arms turn towards the spindle and are connected with the sleeve lugs by short links. A helical spring is placed between the sleeve collar and the bottom of the casing. A rod is connected at one end with the lower part of the casing and at its lower end to a crank fixed on the valve spindle. When the engine shaft rotates above the normal speed, the balls fly outward and they, together with the casing, move upward compressing the spring; this movement acts upon the valve and so reduces the supply of steam. This form of governor can be made as sensitive as desired, and, while being compact, has a considerable motion between its extreme positions; the whole of its working parts, except the sleeve, are utilised in producing the controlling force.

Object entry information: This is an example of the form of steam engine governor patented by Mr. W. Hartnell in 1876. It is very powerful, as the controlling force is derived mainly from a compressed spring, the initial compression of which can be adjusted so as to make the governor as sensitive as desired. It was originally designed for use with expansion gears which automatically control the point of cut-off of the steam in the cylinder, but is now used for all types of engines with throttle valve control.

Object entry information: In this regulator, patented by Messrs. E. and W. Buss in 1870, a hollow vertical spindle, driven from the engine, carries at its upper end a bracket having four arms directed downward. These serve as centres for two swinging frames, each consisting of a horizontal portion, forming an axis, and a vertical arm carrying weights at right angles to one another, the weight on the vertical arm being much smaller than that on the horizontal one, which is on the opposite side of the vertical axis. The frames are directly connected with a crosshead on a sleeve capable of sliding on the spindle and carrying with it an internal rod, which is connected with a throttle valve, arranged below, and controlling the supply of steam to the engine. This construction gives a governor which is in neutral equilibrium at its extreme positions 20 deg. apart, while between these extremes it is very sensitive, but possesses sufficient stability for the purpose of steam engine regulation.

Date of creation: 1911
Object entry information: This is an example of the form of governor patented by Mr. Scott-Moncrieff in 1872. In it a centrifugal pump forces oil into a cylinder containing a loaded piston; an increase of speed increases the oil pressure, so raising the piston and partially closing a throttle valve with which it is connected. The governor has a cylindrical chamber with a central diaphragm, one half forming an oil reservoir and the other the pump chamber. The oil enters the pump at the centre from the reservoir, and passes into a vertical cylinder cast on one side of the chamber. The piston is an easy fit in the cylinder, so that a small quantity of oil leaks past it, and is returned to the reservoir. The piston rod passes through a stuffing-box, and is connected with the weighted arm of a pivoted lever, the opposite arm of which is attached to the spindle of a rotating throttle valve. The speed is regulated by varying the position of the weight on the lever. The pump spindle runs in bearings in the chamber ends, and one end passes through a stuffing-box, and has the driving pulley fixed to it.

Object entry information: Three balls are employed, each fixed in the middle of a separate plate spring. These springs are attached to a collar formed on the driving spindle. The upper ends of the springs are secured to a cap at the top of the column, the cap being free to revolve and to rise and fall, so that as the balls diverge under the centrifugal force the top cap is drawn down, carrying with it a central shaft which is connected with a throttle valve contained in the lower casing. A helical spring is arranged to act upon an arm connected with the central spindle, and by means of a worm and worm wheel can be adjusted so as to alter the speed while running.
The example shown is for a steam pipe 1 in. diam., and should make 300 rev. per min.

Object entry information: In this governor, patented by Mr. H. Lindley in 1884, the usual balls are replaced by two hemispheres capable of swinging outward round two lower centres, but forming, when closed, one sphere. The centrifugal tendency of the two hemispheres is resisted by two helical springs acting directly, while the spreading motion of the revolving masses is transmitted by upper links to a central spindle which passes downward to an equilibrium throttle valve placed in the steam pipe below. By means of a sliding block, which can be adjusted while the governor is running, the action of a third spring can be caused to increase or diminish the resistance to centrifugal force, thereby altering the speed of the engine.

Object entry information: This governor regulates the speed by cutting off the steam at an earlier point in the stroke when the speed rises above the normal amount, so giving a higher grade of expansion as the power required from the engine diminishes. It is arranged for fitting to a simple engine with the ordinary slide valve, and so converts it into one with an automatic expansion gear. The upper part consists of a Buss governor similar to No. 238, but below this, instead of a throttle valve, is a cylindrical gridiron valve. This valve is in the main steam pipe, as near the cylinder as possible, and is slightly oscillated by a trip gear rocked by the eccentric rod of the ordinary slide valve. The gear consists of a horizontal rocking shaft carrying two catches, which engage with a stop on the expansion valve spindle, but when free the valve is returned by springs to the closed position. The catches project upward as curved horns, while a nearly horizontal arm from the governor spindle obstructs the swing of these horns, and so releases the catches at a period of their swing dependent upon the position of the governor balls. A dash-pot is provided to steady the tripping arm.

Object name: SHAFT GOVERNOR.
Maker/Donor: Lent by A. S. F. Robinson, Esq.
Date of creation: 1904
Object entry information: In this arrangement of centrifugal governor directly secured to the engine shaft, the speed of the engine is regulated by its varying the point of cut-off of the steam. It accomplishes this by altering the position of the eccentric on the shaft in such a way that the angular advance and travel of the valve are varied while the lead remains constant. It was patented in 1894–9 by Mr. Robinson. The mechanism is enclosed in a hollow flywheel or pulley fixed to the engine shaft, while the eccentric sheave is carried on one side of a frame composed of a pair of guide plates, placed one on each side of the wheel and connected by four shouldered studs passing through slotted holes in the wheel faces. The studs are joined in pairs by two bridge pieces, which are each tied by two steel strips to opposite lugs on the inside of the wheel rim. The eccentric frame and strips form a “Watt” parallel motion, constraining the eccentric to move approximately in a straight line at right angles to the crank, so as to maintain a practically constant lead. This frame is held in position by a pair of laminated steel springs, curved outward round the boss and passing between the parallel motion strips; these springs are fixed at one end to adjustable supports attached to the wheel, and at the other, to one of the bridge pieces of the sliding frame. The springs are controlled by four swinging levers pivoted at the fulcrums and coupled together in pairs by links and compensating levers; these act through links and rolling contact pieces, which bear upon the inside of the curved part of the springs, so that when the levers fly outward the springs are pulled apart and the eccentric frame is moved towards the centre. The speed of the engine is adjusted by moving the fixed ends of the laminated springs, which can be effected while the engine is in motion by means of a disc sliding along the shaft; this disc carries a projecting rack, which engages with a pinion attached to a right and left handed screw, passing through the ends of short levers upon which the springs are mounted.

Object entry information: This is an example of the centrifugal governor, for high speed engines and steam turbines, patented by Mr. W. Jahns in 1912. It is very sensitive, as the weights move horizontally, and is constructed so as to eliminate friction as far as possible. The governor is contained in an oil-tight casing fixed to the top of a vertical shaft. The weights are flat and are fitted with vertical and horizontal rollers running on planes prepared for them on the casing. The weights are pressed towards the centre by helical springs, fitting into recesses in them, and tightened up by nuts screwed on a central stud passing through a hole in the top of the shaft. The nuts fit into holes in the cylindrical portion of the casing, and the springs are adjusted by inserting washers behind them. Vertical slots, formed through the weights, enable them to engage with rollers mounted on the upright arms of two bellcrank levers pivoted on the casing; the lower arms of these levers engage with inclined

The mechanism is enclosed in a hollow flywheel or pulley fixed to the engine shaft, while the eccentric sheave is carried on one side of a frame composed of a pair of guide plates, placed one on each side of the wheel and connected by four shouldered studs passing through slotted holes in the wheel faces. The studs are joined in pairs by two bridge pieces, which are each tied by two steel strips to opposite lugs on the inside of the wheel rim. The eccentric frame and strips form a “Watt” parallel motion, constraining the eccentric to move approximately in a straight line at right angles to the crank, so as to maintain a practically constant lead. This frame is held in position by a pair of laminated steel springs, curved outward round the boss and passing between the parallel motion strips; these springs are fixed at one end to adjustable supports attached to the wheel, and at the other, to one of the bridge pieces of the sliding frame. The springs are controlled by four swinging levers pivoted at the fulcrums and coupled together in pairs by links and compensating levers; these act through links and rolling contact pieces, which bear upon the inside of the curved part of the springs, so that when the levers fly outward the springs are pulled apart and the eccentric frame is moved towards the centre. The speed of the engine is adjusted by moving the fixed ends of the laminated springs, which can be effected while the engine is in motion by means of a disc sliding along the shaft; this disc carries a projecting rack, which engages with a pinion attached to a right and left handed screw, passing through the ends of short levers upon which the springs are mounted.",Inv. 1904-9.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

Object name: HARTUNG'S GOVERNOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Hartung, Kuhn & Co.
Date of creation: 1905
Object entry information: This governor, which was patented by Herr H. Hartung in Germany in 1893, and is widely used, is of the spring-loaded centrifugal type. The weights are flat but shaped on the rim to quit an external cylindrical casing keyed to the vertical governor spindle. Each weight is supported on the longer arm of a bellcrank lever which has its fulcrum in the casing, whilst the other arm is attached by a link to the sliding collar. The weights in all positions thus vary but slightly from one horizontal plane so that the disturbing effect of gravity is almost eliminated. The weights are loaded by helical springs screwed on a through bolt, thus allowing of adjustment within narrow limits. This linkwork therefore remains unloaded; internal friction is consequently small, which makes the governor sensitive and reduces wear. The governor is so nearly isochronous, that a wide range in the number of revolutions cannot be obtained by altering the tension of the springs. Weights, however, may be placed on the sliding collar or a spring balance may be attached to the linkwork for this purpose; this, however, increases friction and diminishes sensitiveness. The casing acts as a protection against dirt, etc., while the top is easily removable to gain access to the springs.

Object entry information: In this arrangement of centrifugal governor directly secured to the engine shaft, the speed of the engine is regulated by its varying the point of cut-off of the steam. It accomplishes this by altering the position of the eccentric on the shaft in such a way that the angular advance and travel of the valve are varied while the lead remains constant. It was patented in 1894–9 by Mr. Robinson.

Date of creation: 1913
Object entry information: This is an example of the centrifugal governor, for high speed engines and steam turbines, patented by Mr. W. Jahns in 1912. It is very sensitive, as the weights move horizontally, and is constructed so as to eliminate friction as far as possible. The governor is contained in an oil-tight casing fixed to the top of a vertical shaft. The weights are flat and are fitted with vertical and horizontal rollers running on planes prepared for them on the casing. The weights are pressed towards the centre by helical springs, fitting into recesses in them, and tightened up by nuts screwed on a central stud passing through a hole in the top of the shaft. The nuts fit into holes in the cylindrical portion of the casing, and the springs are adjusted by inserting washers behind them. Vertical slots, formed through the weights, enable them to engage with rollers mounted on the upright arms of two bellcrank levers pivoted on the casing; the lower arms of these levers engage with inclined

Object entry information: This form of condenser was patented in 1869–73 by Mr. J. W. McCarter, the object being to dispense with the usual air pump. It consists of a vertical cylinder that acts as an ordinary jet condenser. Below the condenser is a closed vessel into which the condensed water flows through a foot valve, and from which it is discharged by a delivery valve. Steam is admitted to this closed chamber by a valve driven by tappets on a rotating shaft above, so as to give six short admissions of steam per minute. At the same time that the steam valve is opened a similar delivery valve is opened, the air and condensed water being thus blown out by the steam. The arrangement is equivalent to using Savery’s engine or a pulsometer in the place of the ordinary air pump. A number of lithographs show applications of this condenser.

Object entry information: This construction of air-cooled condenser was patented in 1895 by Mr. T. Clarkson, and has been extensively adopted for condensing the steam or cooling the water used in motor cars, owing to the large amount of cooling surface it presents to the air in proportion to the weight of the apparatus. The fluid to be cooled is passed through a central tube of thin copper, the specimens shown being 0.25 and 0.5 in. bore respectively, and the exterior of the tube has rolled into it a continuous helical depression into which is wound a continuous helical spring, whose coils slightly interlock and are held into the air bed by an internal wire wound with it. The whole tube, with its added radiating surface, is then dipped in molten tin, by which complete metallic contact is made between the tube and the wires, while increased rigidity is conferred by the connection which the tin establishes between the successive coils at their points of contact. The small diameter of the radiating wire gives great surface in proportion to its weight, while the high conductivity of the copper, together with the metallic connection, ensures that the heat is conveyed to the wire loops as fast as the large amount of freely exposed surface disperses it to the passing air.

Within the water cone is an air-jacketed nozzle, by which a jet of live steam can be introduced for starting the apparatus.
The larger example shows a later form, in which an adjustable central jet of live steam does any lifting of the cooling water that may be necessary, or created vacuum. A closed portion of the combined chamber and a hollow cone are also added, by which any portion of the combined jet which may be too feeble to pass into the diverging tube is carried back into the jet, to be again exposed to the exhaust steam; at the same time it checks the ordinary supply of injection water until the apparatus is again clear.

Object entry information: This apparatus, patented in 1882 by Mr. E. Körting, is for a similar purpose as the preceding.
It consists of a series of nozzles discharging into an expanding tube as in the ordinary injector, but a large number of drilled holes pointing in the direction of the flow permits of a further addition of steam to increase the velocity. An internal sliding tube, adjustable by a hand-lever, permits of the covering of these holes when starting, and of their being set in the position of maximum efficiency, as indicated by a vacuum gauge, when on regular work. The condensing or injection water enters at the top, and passing through the water nozzle has its velocity increased on entering the condensing tube, which is in the exhaust steam space, by the condensation in it of the steam. This velocity is further increased by the jets of steam entering through the inclined side holes. The condensed steam and the water rush downward to the outlet from which they can be carried to a cooling pond or elsewhere. At the top is a small nozzle by which a jet of live steam can be introduced at starting, so as to lift the injection water and prime the apparatus.

Object entry information: This is a condensing apparatus of the form patented by Mons. F. Fouché in 1880–1905, in which steam is condensed by passing it through passages of special form around which an opposite current of air is induced by a fan. It may also be used to heat air by means of exhaust or live steam for drying or ventilating purposes.
The apparatus consists of a rectangular sheet iron chamber, at one end of which is fitted a fan driven by an electric motor. Within the chamber are placed vertically a number of hollow plates, each consisting of two thin metal sheets fastened together at the edges, a short distance apart, thus forming narrow rectangular passages which expose a large surface to the air current. These plates are connected together, with the steam inlet at one end and with the outlet at the other end, the steam flowing in the opposite direction to the air. At the connection each plate has a circular orifice surrounded by a concentric projection on one sheet and a corresponding depression on the other, and between the two sheets is inserted a perforated ring which supports the joints while allowing the steam to pass through the plates. Between each pair of plates suitably shaped distance rings are placed, and closing washers over the holes in the outside members of the group; the plates and rings are then drawn tightly together by bolts passing through the connecting holes, jointing material being introduced if necessary. The sheets forming the hollow plates are stayed at intervals by being stamped inward to meet, and riveted together.
The small specimen shown will deliver 350 cub. ft. of air per min., with the fan running at 2,000 rev. per min.; it will condense 35 lb. of steam per hour and raise the temperature of the air from 60 deg. F. to 124 deg. F. when working without a vacuum, or 22 lb. of steam and an air temperature of 100 deg. F. when working with a vacuum.

Object entry information: In this construction of air pump for a condensing steam engine, which was patented in 1894 by Mr. F. Edwards, there are neither foot nor bucket valves, a simplification which reduces the vertical height of the pump and increases the practical working speed. The pump is either attached to the side of the condenser and driven by rocking beams or is entirely separate from the engine and driven by an overhead crankshaft combined with it. The lower opening into the casing communicates with the bottom of the condenser while the upper one leads to the hot-well; a side door near the top gives access to the delivery valves, and there is a safety valve to prevent any pressure accumulating when “blowing through,” or if the condenser should become hot. The cover of the casing has a gland for the pump rod, but the use of a second gland is avoided by prolonging the stuffing box downward till it makes a joint with the internal cover carrying the delivery valves. The working pump barrel is a separate liner fixed to and supported by the casing. The bucket of the pump is a complete piston which during its down-stroke is forming a vacuum above it, but when nearly at the bottom of its stroke, it passes over radial ports through the barrel, through which passages the water and air from the condenser rush into the vacuum above the piston; the piston at the same time acts as a displacer in removing the fluids accumulated below it to its upper side. In the following up-stroke these fluids are discharged through the delivery valves in the cover as the piston approaches the top of its stroke; the piston is not packed, except by the water upon it, and the clearance volume at the top of its stroke is small. The bottom of the piston is made conical to avoid shock when displacing the water beneath it and, owing to the way this water is thrown on to the upper side of the piston and there entrapped, the arrangement will work even without valves. The valves are of the disc type and are water sealed, but they can be easily removed or replaced when the pump is at work.

The disc is free to move so that it can ""beat"" over its whole surface. Indiarubber is found to be very durable, if oil be absent. The valve is 6 in. diam.

Object entry information: As mineral oil has a solvent action on indiarubber, its introduction has led to the disuse of that material (see No. 261) for air pump valves. Flexible metal clacks held by set screws along one edge were introduced in 1848 by Edward Humphrys, but had a tendency to break along the line of flexure. This is avoided by the use of the curved guard shown which at the same time holds the clack along a diameter as patented in 1878 by Mr. J. G. Kinghorn and adopted for phosphor-bronze sheet, or gun-metal sheet, often elliptical in shape, as shown, and rests on a suitable grating. In the other form of valve shown, known as the ""Multiplex,"" there are several thin discs of the same metal of decreasing diameters loose on a central stud and lifting against a flat guard. Each disc except the topmost one has some small holes through it and acts as a seating for the one above it. They close on a grating successively and independently, so reducing the shock.

Object entry information: This form of valve, for air or water pumps, was patented by Mr. Downie in 1901. The valve is stamped from sheet metal, and has a long boss at the centre which stiffens the valve and acts as a guide, and a turned-up edge which stiffens the valve and allows water to accumulate, thus forming a cushion seating, and on this a flat guard-plate is fixed to limit the lift. A central stud projects from the valve boss, and passes through the guard-plate, the hole in the guard-plate being bored out to accommodate the valve boss.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. S. Dixon & Son, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1920.
Object entry information: This lubricator is intended for such situations, e.g., locomotives, where glass sight feeds are inapplicable. It is of the form patented in 1862 by Mr. J. Roscoe.
The vessel, filled with oil, is in communication with the cylinder, &c., by a horizontal steam pipe which can be closed by a screw-in valve opposite to it. Steam entering the vessel is condensed by contact with the lubricant, and displaces a drop of oil which passes out by the same pipe as that by which the steam entered. This goes on till all the oil is displaced and the vessel is full of condensed water; it is then emptied by the screw tap at the lower end. The vent of this tap is in communication with the interior by a hole in the lower part of a vertical pipe. When steam is shut off the air contained in this pipe expands and keeps up a supply of oil for a short time. A sectional drawing (scale 1 : 2) shows the construction.
The lubricator is 2⋅125 in. diam. and its capacity 0⋅25 pint.

The cup for containing the lubricant (a sample of which is shown in a glass jar) is screwed internally with the nipple screwing into the bearing. Upon slightly turning this cup, or cap, some of the grease is forced into the bearing and in this way the lubricant is supplied at short intervals while its viscosity prevents its flowing away. In a later form, which is shown in section, there is a small spring-loaded piston on the cap, which gives a continuous supply and indicates when the cap requires to be screwed further home; the rate of feed is adjustable by an internal set screw which contracts the delivery passage.

Object entry information: The tower is of the natural draught chimney type and is in the form of a truncated pyramid frame of timber cross-braced and close boarded inside with the exception of the lowest part, where the air is admitted through slats or louvres. In the filling for the interior, which is of the form patented by Mr. J. H. Brown in 1905, particular attention has been paid to the following points: unimpeded upward circulation of air, continuous subdivision of the descending stream of water, and spreading of the water as a film over a large surface. This is achieved by the use of wooden arris rails nailed to short battens in groups of three to constitute a hurdle; copper is used for all fastenings. The hurdles drop into seats on beams bolted to an internal framework in such a position that one side of every rail is vertical, and that the rails are arranged stepwise. The hurdles of one tier are arranged to the reverse hand of that of the one above. The hurdles do not require to be nailed down and can be removed readily when necessary.
The water is distributed by a cross-launder to a net-work of troughs over which it flows on to the hurdles. Notches in the rails check the tendency of the water to form into streams, and cause instead trickling from one hurdle to the next one below. Steam passes off at the top of the tower, and water, cooled to several degrees below that of the surrounding atmosphere, collects in the reservoir below (see lower part of case).
These towers are made in convenient units up to about 40,000 gallons per hour capacity.

Date of creation: Patented in France by Mons. A. M. Mollerin in 1881.
Object entry information: This is an example of a positively driven lubricator patented in France by Mons. A. M. Mollerin in 1881. It is employed extensively on the Continent, and a modified form is manufactured in this country.
It consists of a lower vessel to contain oil, fitted with a hollow plunger or piston, which is actuated by an arrangement of ratchet, worm and screw gearing. The upper end of the piston forms a nut for a square-threaded screw which has a worm driven by a ratchet wheel, the latter obtaining its motion by its attachment to a reciprocating part of the engine. Thus at every stroke of the engine a slight turn is imparted to the square-threaded screw, and this, being fixed in position, causes the nut, i.e., the piston, to descend and force out oil into the distributing pipe, which is attached to the upper part of the oil cylinder. The rate of oil feed can be adjusted to suit the requirements by moving a sliding block on the ratchet arm. When a wing nut above the plunger screw is tightened, the worm wheel and the screw rotate as one, but when this nut is loose, the worm wheel and the plunger can be raised or lowered by turning the handle at the top of the lubricator.
To fill the lubricator, the wing nut is slackened and the plunger is drawn to the top of its stroke. Oil can then be poured into the lower vessel through the cup at the side.
The rotation of the plunger is prevented by a piece of bent wire, U-shaped at its upper end, which is guided by a vertical fixed wire rod. The screw is only just long enough to allow the plunger to reach its lowest position and empty the vessel of oil; any further rotation then winds the screw out of the plunger.

Date of creation: 1903.
Object entry information: This is a sectioned example of the mechanical lubricator patented in 1893 by Mr. T. W. Lees by which the oil required is forced into the cylinder or bearing at a visible and adjustable rate by a small pump driven by the machine.
The apparatus consists of an oil reservoir from which, by an adjustable side orifice, the oil passes, in drops within a vertical glass tube, to a passage leading into a small ram pump. The ram extends upward into the reservoir, where there is an eccentric on a shaft slowly rotated by an external ratchet wheel, driven by a pawl on an adjustable lever rocked by the engine or shafting. The delivery valve of the pump is spring-loaded and serves also as a check valve, but a suction valve is dispensed with, as the plunger is arranged to overshoot, and thereby close the orifice admitting the oil into the barrel.
During the up-stroke the accumulated drops of oil sucked from the reservoir pass into the pump, to be forced out through the check valve during the completion of the down-stroke.

The screw is only just long enough to allow the plunger to reach its lowest position and empty the vessel of oil; any further rotation then winds the screw out of the plunger.

Object entry information: This is a sectioned example of the mechanical lubricator patented in 1893 by Mr. T. W. Lees by which the oil required is forced into the cylinder or bearing at a visible and adjustable rate by a small pump driven by the machine.
The apparatus consists of an oil reservoir from which, by an adjustable side orifice, the oil passes, in drops within a vertical glass tube, to a passage leading into a small ram pump. The ram extends upward into the reservoir, where there is an eccentric on a shaft slowly rotated by an external ratchet wheel, driven by a pawl on an adjustable lever rocked by the engine or shafting. The delivery valve of the pump is spring-loaded and serves also as a check valve, but a suction valve is dispensed with, as the plunger is arranged to overshoot, and thereby close the orifice admitting the oil into the barrel.
During the up-stroke the accumulated drops of oil sucked from the reservoir pass into the pump, to be forced out through the check valve during the completion of the down-stroke.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Sidney Moorhouse & Co.
Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This is an apparatus for automatically feeding drops of oil into the steam pipe of an engine, in order to lubricate the slide valve and piston. The simple form of displacement lubricator in which steam is admitted to a chamber containing oil, where it condenses and displaces the oil, causing it to overflow into the cylinder, was patented by Mr. J. Ramsbottom in 1860; the success of this form was subsequently improved by the addition of controlling valves and a glass tube filled with water through which the drops of oil float up so as to render the rate of feed visible.
The lubricator shown consists of a large oil chamber having a filling plug at the top and a cock at the bottom for draining off the accumulated water. The steam is condensed in a chamber at the top of a long vertical pipe and passes, through a controlling valve, into the bottom of the oil chamber. The displaced oil passes from the top of the chamber down an internal pipe which leads, through a valve, to a fine nozzle placed at the bottom of a glass tube attached to one side of the chamber. The oil floats up through the water in the tube and is led to the engine steam pipe, along which it is carried by the rush of steam.

Date of creation: Patented in France by Mons. A. M. Mollerin in 1881.
Object entry information: This is an example of a positively driven lubricator patented in France by Mons. A. M. Mollerin in 1881. It is employed extensively on the Continent, and a modified form is manufactured in this country.
It consists of a lower vessel to contain oil, fitted with a hollow plunger or piston, which is actuated by an arrangement of ratchet, worm and screw gearing. The upper end of the piston forms a nut for a square-threaded screw which has a worm driven by a ratchet wheel, the latter obtaining its motion by its attachment to a reciprocating part of the engine. Thus at every stroke of the engine a slight turn is imparted to the square-threaded screw, and this, being fixed in position, causes the nut, i.e., the piston, to descend and force out oil into the distributing pipe, which is attached to the upper part of the oil cylinder. The rate of oil feed can be adjusted to suit the requirements by moving a sliding block on the ratchet arm. When a wing nut above the plunger screw is tightened, the worm wheel and the screw rotate as one, but when this nut is loose, the worm wheel and the plunger can be raised or lowered by turning the handle at the top of the lubricator.
To fill the lubricator, the wing nut is slackened and the plunger is drawn to the top of its stroke. Oil can then be poured into the lower vessel through the cup at the side.
The rotation of the plunger is prevented by a piece of bent wire, U-shaped at its upper end, which is guided by a vertical fixed wire rod. The screw is only just long enough to allow the plunger to reach its lowest position and empty the vessel of oil; any further rotation then winds the screw out of the plunger.

Object entry information: This lubricator was patented by Mr. J. F. Lewis, of Philadelphia, in 1905. In it the grease contained in the cup is fed to the bearing in a constant stream by air compressed in an inverted cup-shaped cap which screws into the body of the lubricator. The cap or air container has a flat disc which fits loosely within it and which, whilst being free to move vertically, is made to rotate with the cap by means of a flat link sliding in a central guide tube. As the cap is screwed into the body the disc flattens the grease and prevents the air from forcing a passage through the screwed joint. The grease itself acts as a seal and prevents leakage at the screwed joint. A funnel in the cup helps to secure an even flow, and is pierced by small holes through which grease escapes when the disc rests on the top of the funnel. Should the adjustment of the cap be neglected the journal will communicate its rise in temperature to the air, which will expand and increase the supply of lubricant.

Object entry information: This is a sectional example of the forced feed lubricator patented by Mr. E. Woerner in 1908, and subsequently improved by the makers. The lubricator can be used for all kinds of machinery, and is arranged to supply oil under pressure to from two to eight different points; each service has its own separate pump, and is provided with a sight-feed tube which is not under pressure. The oil supply is proportional to the speed of the machine, which itself drives the lubricator. The pumps are arranged vertically in a circle round the driving shaft, each having a plunger and a piston valve, the latter being nearest to the shaft. The shaft carries at its upper end an inclined disc or swash-plate, the edge of which engages with notches cut in the upper ends of the valves, and so causes them to reciprocate once in each revolution of the shaft. Above the swash-plate is loosely mounted another disc, which has its edge in the form of two upper and two lower horizontal portions connected by inclines; this disc engages with notches formed in the heads of the pump plungers, and by its revolution causes them to reciprocate twice in each revolution of the shaft. The upper disc is set 45 deg. behind the lower one, and it is driven by a pin which engages with the ends of a slot cut in the boss of the lower disc, this arrangement allows the lubricator to be driven in either direction, the lower disc being allowed to set itself with the necessary lead. The valve and pump passages are so formed that during one up-stroke of the plunger the oil is passed through the sight tube and returned to the oil chamber, while on the next down-stroke it is forced out into the service pipe, each pump acting in turn as the shaft revolves. The quantity of oil delivered by each pump can be varied by means.

Object entry information: This shows a form of strainer for lubricating or fuel oil, patented by Mr. F. C. Fulle in 1919, and is intended to replace strainers which are dependent for their action on gauze or perforated metal. The oil or other fluid is passed through a series of fine slots in the wall of a cylindrical cartridge formed by a pile of circular metal discs mounted on a central spindle and interleaved by thin washers, the thickness of which is a measure of the fineness of the straining required. The dirt suspended in the liquid is intercepted by the edges of the discs, which in course of time become coated. To clear off the dirt the handle at the end of the strainer is given a quarter turn, which revolves the discs against a series of stationary cleaning blades which are slightly thinner than the distance between the slots. The cleaning edge of the blades is set obliquely to the periphery of the cartridge face. The blades therefore have a wedging action on the dirt, carrying it from the inside to the outside of the slot, and clear of the cartridge face. The dirt settles to the bottom of the sump provided which may be cleaned out by removing the screwed plug. The base, coupling bolts and tubular body can be removed, fully exposing the cartridge if required for inspection purposes.

Object entry information: These specimens show the construction and method of manufacture of an elastic nut patented by Mr. F. Mottershall in 1892. The nut consists of a short length of a closely wound helix which is tapped with a thread of slightly less pitch than that of the bolt it is to fit, so that screwing the nut on to the bolt causes the helix to lengthen and thus give a continuous grip for the purpose of preventing slacking back by vibration. The nuts are made from a mild steel bar of trapezoidal section, which is wound, while cold, as a left-hand thread upon a central mandrel in a coiling machine resembling a lathe. The distortion of the bar in winding alters the section of the steel; the mandrel is, however, so rotated that a close coil is obtained; the metal is easily released by slightly reversing the twist. This tube is then cut by circular saws into lengths sufficient for single nuts, which are tapped with a thread of slightly smaller diameter and finer pitch than the standard bolt. If the square or hexagonal shape is required the nuts are passed through a shearing press which, in two stages, remove segments so as to leave the faces required; the chamfering and finishing are performed in a subsequent operation.

Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: These specimens show the construction and method of manufacture of an elastic nut patented by Mr. F. Mottershall in 1892. The nut consists of a short length of a closely wound helix which is tapped with a thread of slightly less pitch than that of the bolt it is to fit, so that screwing the nut on to the bolt causes the helix to lengthen and thus give a continuous grip for the purpose of preventing slacking back by vibration. The nuts are made from a mild steel bar of trapezoidal section, which is wound, while cold, as a left-hand thread upon a central mandrel in a coiling machine resembling a lathe. The distortion of the bar in winding alters the section of the steel; the mandrel is, however, so rotated that a close coil is obtained; the metal is easily released by slightly reversing the twist. This tube is then cut by circular saws into lengths sufficient for single nuts, which are tapped with a thread of slightly smaller diameter and finer pitch than the standard bolt. If the square or hexagonal shape is required the nuts are passed through a shearing press which, in two stages, remove segments so as to leave the faces required; the chamfering and finishing are performed in a subsequent operation.

Object entry information: This form of lock nut was patented by Mr. A. E. Terry in 1908. It locks itself on its bolt by means of a helical wire spring which is fitted in a recess formed in the upper part of the nut and is coiled round the thread. One end of the coil is secured in a hole in the nut while the other end is normally free. The nut may be easily screwed on, because the coil tends to unwind and thus frees the bolt, but, should the nut tend to unscrew, the coil will wind itself and securely grip the bolt thread. The lock is released by the insertion of a pin, through a hole, so as to push back the free end of the coil and prevent it from closing on the bolt. A complete bolt and nut, 1 in. diam., are shown, and also a sectioned nut with its coil.

Lambie. The blank is first sheared circumferentially in two places, thereby stretching the metal. The resulting segments are then sheared radially, thus forming when bent four tongues, the sharp edges of which tend to bite and prevent rotation of the nut. The washers are of spring steel hardened in oil and can be used repeatedly. A number of sizes from 0.25 in. to 1.25 in. diam. galvanised by electro deposition are shown, but black washers are obtainable.

In the angle of the nut a slotted hole accommodates a steel spindle with three hardened and backed-off teeth matching the threads. A coiled spring tends to rotate the spindle and make the teeth dig into the bolt thread when unscrewing. To retain the spindle in the free position there is a lever on it, with a stop on its underside catching on a burr on the nut. All sizes from 0.125 in. diam. upwards, with or without the releasing lever, are made. The size shown is 1 in. diam.

To lock the nut, the top half is rotated relative to the lower. Not only does this give the wedging action of ordinary double nuts, but it introduces also a radial pressure due to the wedging of the dovetail; it is claimed that this renders the nut immovable. The thread is not damaged and the nut can be used repeatedly.

Date of creation: 1909.
Object entry information: These are specimens of the roller clutch type of lock nut containing improvements patented by Mr. W. R. Bevan in 1908. The nut has a longitudinal slot cut inside it, deeper at one edge than the other. A grooved roller lies in this slot and is pressed towards the narrow end by a flat spring, so that when the nut is screwed on to the bolt the roller frees itself, but should the nut tend to unscrew, the roller jams itself between the bolt thread and the back of the slot, preventing further relative motion. A hardened plate is inserted in the slot behind the roller, and the nut is recessed at the top and bottom for the reception of lipped washers that hold the roller and springs in place; the ends of the rollers are turned smaller for this purpose. In order to release the nut, a pin or wire nail is inserted through a hole in the top washer. One of the specimens shown, which are for bolts of 1 in. diam., has two rollers fitted so that it cannot move in either direction until a releasing pin is placed between the rollers to hold them out of engagement with the bolt.

Lambie. The blank is first sheared circumferentially in two places, thereby stretching the metal. The resulting segments are then sheared radially, thus forming when bent four tongues, the sharp edges of which tend to bite and prevent rotation of the nut. The washers are of spring steel hardened in oil and can be used repeatedly. A number of sizes from 0.25 in. to 1.25 in. diam. galvanised by electro deposition are shown, but black washers are obtainable.

In the angle of the nut a slotted hole accommodates a steel spindle with three hardened and backed-off teeth matching the threads. A coiled spring tends to rotate the spindle and make the teeth dig into the bolt thread when unscrewing. To retain the spindle in the free position there is a lever on it, with a stop on its underside catching on a burr on the nut.

They are designed for working pressures up to 500 lb. per sq. in. and are specially suited for air pressure mains. The joint consists of two steel liners and a steel nut, all of which are pressed into shape hydraulically. The nut has prominent external ribs which take the standard spanner and also permit the joint to be tightened up by a hammer and bar in positions where a spanner could not be used. The liners are also ribbed to assist them on the ends of the pipes to be joined in place so that they are immovable. The bronze seats are pressed into place so that they are across its thread so that a screw of the nut has grooves cut across its thread so that paraffin may be introduced to loosen it if necessary. The nut and liners are sherardized after the threads are cut, and so made rust proof.

Maker/Donor: Presented by The Crosby Valve and Engineering Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1920.
Object entry information: These are examples of the pipe union patented by the Rockwood Sprinkler Co., in 1914. The unions are made of pressed steel and are fitted with spherical faced bronze seats which are ground together to form a tight joint. They are designed for working pressures up to 500 lb. per sq. in. and are specially suited for air pressure mains. The joint consists of two steel liners and a steel nut, all of which are pressed into shape hydraulically. The nut has prominent external ribs which take the standard spanner and also permit the joint to be tightened up by a hammer and bar in positions where a spanner could not be used. The liners are also ribbed to assist them on the ends of the pipes to be joined in place so that they are immovable. The bronze seats are pressed into place so that they are across its thread so that a screw of the nut has grooves cut across its thread so that paraffin may be introduced to loosen it if necessary. The nut and liners are sherardized after the threads are cut, and so made rust proof.

Object entry information: The victaulic joint is really a development from the hydraulic U-packing. The leak-proof ring is in effect two oppositely-placed rubber U-washers made in one piece, with the important feature that the inturned lips are made to grip the pipe ends radially. The joint was patented in 1919 by Mr. E. Tribe and developed by him and Dr. H. S. Hele-Shaw. Two forms of joint are illustrated by examples and drawings; in the pipe shown for low pressures and vacuum, the pipes being buried or anchored, the leak-proof ring and its malleable iron housing is simply slipped over adjacent ends of the pipes. The pipe shown is 3.5 in. outside diam. In the ""A,"" or floating joint for high pressures and pipes free to move, the leak-proof ring is similar, but the ends of the pipe are grooved circumferentially. The housing is in halves and the leak-proof ring fits into these grooves, where it is retained on endways and retained by set screws. This pipe is 2 in. internal diam. There are other applications of the ring, e.g., in gland packing. It is claimed for this joint that it takes up very little space and thus saves freight, &c.; that it is as easily assembled or dismantled quickly without requiring skilled labour; that it is flexible to 3 deg. in any direction without leakage; that it permits expansion because the ends of the pipe do not butt; that it is not affected by vibration or subsidence; and that it is not greater in prime cost than the ordinary flanged joint.

Object name: VICTAULIC PIPE JOINTS.
Maker/Donor: The Victory Pipe Joint Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The victaulic joint is really a development from the hydraulic U-packing. The leak-proof ring is in effect two oppositely-placed rubber U-washers made in one piece, with the important feature that the inturned lips are made to grip the pipe ends radially. The joint was patented in 1919 by Mr. E. Tribe and developed by him and Dr. H. S. Hele-Shaw. Two forms of joint are illustrated by examples and drawings; in the pipe shown for low pressures and vacuum, the pipes being buried or anchored, the leak-proof ring and its malleable iron housing is simply slipped over adjacent ends of the pipes. The pipe shown is 3.5 in. outside diam. In the ""A,"" or floating joint for high pressures and pipes free to move, the leak-proof ring is similar, but the ends of the pipe are grooved circumferentially. The housing is in halves and the leak-proof ring fits into these grooves, where it is retained on endways and retained by set screws. This pipe is 2 in. internal diam. There are other applications of the ring, e.g., in gland packing. It is claimed for this joint that it takes up very little space and thus saves freight, &c.; that it is as easily assembled or dismantled quickly without requiring skilled labour; that it is flexible to 3 deg. in any direction without leakage; that it permits expansion because the ends of the pipe do not butt; that it is not affected by vibration or subsidence; and that it is not greater in prime cost than the ordinary flanged joint.

Object entry information: This expansion joint has no gland or stuffing-box and can be used in inaccessible positions where it would be impracticable to use the ordinary packed joint, or difficult to employ the usual expedients of bends in the pipe. The joint consists of a bored gunmetal body and an accurately fitted inner gunmetal sleeve, the end of which is tapered; this tapered portion expands under the pressure, and ensures tightness. Safety bolts are fitted through the lugs on the flanges to prevent accidental blowing out. The joint exhibited is suitable for a steam pipe 2.5 in. internal diam.

The result of this connection is that each wheel is driven at one-tenth of the speed of the wheel driving it, so that read along a horizontal line the revolutions are indicated in a very convenient form for reading; the advance of each wheel is, however, continuous, so that the trouble of half figures is not avoided.

The dials are on a central fixed stud, which also carries a double-ended pointer. The larger dial has a toothed edge and is driven by a worm from the shaft whose revolutions are to be counted; the ratio of the gearing is 1:100, so the dial counts up to 100 rev. The dial carries thirty-nine teeth fixed to the stud, and also into a wheel of forty teeth secured to the back of the inner dial. By this means the inner dial, which reads up to 4,000, is rotated at 1-40th of the speed of the outer one.

Object entry information: This counter indicates by the use of two concentric revolving dials geared together by an epicyclic train. The dials are on a central fixed stud, which also carries a double-ended pointer. The larger dial has a toothed edge and is driven by a worm from the shaft whose revolutions are to be counted; the ratio of the gearing is 1:100, so the dial counts up to 100 rev. The dial carries thirty-nine teeth fixed to the stud, and also into a wheel of forty teeth secured to the back of the inner dial. By this means the inner dial, which reads up to 4,000, is rotated at 1-40th of the speed of the outer one.

Object entry information: This instrument, patented by Sir C. Wheatstone in 1858, consists of two dials over which pointers are moved by gearing from a step-by-step propulsion actuated by an electro-magnet. The poles of the latter are adjacent, and between them oscillates a magnetised needle carrying the arbor of a ratchet wheel of fifteen teeth, which engages with a fixed pawl and is thus slowly turned by the currents received; this motion is recorded by a counter.

Object entry information: This is an early form of counter, the driving spindle of which is held, by hand, in contact with the end of the shaft of which the revolutions are to be counted. The mechanism is contained in a circular brass case having the driving spindle projecting from one edge, while a handle is attached to the opposite point of the circumference. Inside the casing a worm on the spindle drives a worm-wheel to the axis of which an index is attached; this index moves over a dial having 100 divisions, each representing one revolution of the driving spindle. A second index is driven intermittently by a pin on the worm-wheel at one-tenth the speed of the first, so that it registers hundreds of revolutions up to a total of 1,000 rev.

Date of creation: 1858.
Object entry information: This instrument, invented by Mr. Roberts, consists of five wheels, each marked with the ten numerals on the edge; all but the first wheel run loose on the horizontal shaft of the counter. On one side of each wheel is a ten-pointed recess, and on the opposite side of the wheel is an eccentric boss; on each boss is a loose ring from which projects downward a tail that prevents its rotation, while from the face of the ring project three teeth, which engage in the recesses in the adjacent wheel. The result of this connection is that each wheel is driven at one-tenth of the speed of the wheel driving it, so that read along a horizontal line the revolutions are indicated in a very convenient form for reading; the advance of each wheel is, however, continuous, so that the trouble of half figures is not avoided.

The main shaft upon which the drums are mounted passes right through the casing, and may be driven from either end. At the right-hand end of this shaft an eccentric is fitted, the strap of which takes the form of a ring having attached to it an arm projecting downwards and guided between two pins, so that, while the nine-toothed pinion is carried round in a circular path, it cannot rotate on its axis. The pinion gears with an internally toothed ring on the first numbered drum, and as the shaft revolves once the drum makes one-tenth of a turn in the same direction. The counter is fitted in a circular casing, the numbers being formed in indelible black on white porcelain faced drums and brought close up to the glass front.

Object entry information: This is a six-figure revolution counter of the form patented by Messrs. T. R. and T. W. Harding in 1881; it is intended for counting the revolutions of general machinery, the drive being taken directly from a revolving shaft. The counting mechanism is similar to that of the larger counter (see No. 307A), but the arrangement for driving the first numbered drum is different. The main shaft upon which the drums are mounted passes right through the casing, and may be driven from either end. At the right-hand end of this shaft an eccentric is fitted, the strap of which takes the form of a ring having attached to it an arm projecting downwards and guided between two pins, so that, while the nine-toothed pinion is carried round in a circular path, it cannot rotate on its axis. The pinion gears with an internally toothed ring on the first numbered drum, and as the shaft revolves once the drum makes one-tenth of a turn in the same direction. The counter is fitted in a circular casing, the numbers being formed in indelible black on white porcelain faced drums and brought close up to the glass front.

On the spindle of this wheel is a pinion of ten teeth gearing into a wheel of 100 teeth, the disc of which is also graduated, the total ratio being such that one revolution of the worm-wheel is made corresponds with 1,000 rev. on the shaft. The arm carrying the worm-wheel is hinged, so that the whole counter can be thrown out of action without removing it from the shaft, or the gear can be disengaged for bringing the dials to zero.

Object entry information: This is a counter invented by Mr. J. Norton. It is actuated by a reciprocating motion and the index and number dials move intermittently, so that there is no uncertainty through the display of half figures. The operating lever has a pawl mounted upon it that drives a ratchet wheel on the spindle of the index, showing figures through holes in the front plate, which carry the reading to units and tens. There are also six small rotating numbered dials. The first of these has on its spindle a ratchet wheel driven by a single tooth on the pawl actuated by a snail-cam on the index spindle, while a snail-cam on the index spindle drives intermittently a wheel of ten teeth on the second, and so on throughout the series. Light springs, engaging with secondary toothed wheels on the spindles, hold them stationary between the movements.

The motion of the machine is transmitted to the spindle through an extension bar with a triangular pointed outer end, while its inner end is provided with a slot that engages with a pin passing through the spindle. When the counter is at rest this driving pin is covered by a sliding sleeve, held up by a spring, and this sleeve must be depressed by the extension bar before the counter mechanism can operate. The sleeve also works a catch which normally holds the balance wheel of the watch stationary, but releases it when the sleeve is depressed, so that the counter and watch start recording together, and stop together when the pressure on the extension bar is released. The watch reads to one-fifth of a second, and is fitted with the usual zero setter.

Object entry information: This ""motometer,"" patented by Mr. A.

The speed is shown by a pointer, carried loosely on a sleeve, which forms part of a clutch and is driven from a clock train at the rate of one turn per min. The clutch is released momentarily by ratchet gearing, driven from the shaft whose speed is to be observed, and so arranged that the clockwork steadily moves the pointer sleeve while the shaft makes 1200 rev. and then releases it, so that the distance thus travelled by the pointer is greater the lower the speed of the shaft. The pointer and sleeves are, by spiral springs, continually tending to fly back to the starting position when released, and the pointer is also fitted with a brake which retains it over its last reading till it is momentarily released, to permit of its moving into the fresh position should the speed have altered during the last interval. In another and more obvious form of the instrument, the shaft drives the clutch and pointer, while the clockwork releases the clutch at intervals of one minute, the pointer being, however, retained at its last reading as above until the end of the fresh minute.

The sleeve also works a catch which normally holds the balance wheel of the watch stationary, but releases it when the sleeve is depressed, so that the counter and watch start recording together, and stop together when the pressure on the extension bar is released. The watch reads to one-fifth of a second, and is fitted with the usual zero setter.

Object entry information: This ""motometer,"" patented by Mr. A. Barlow in 1875, is designed to show on a dial the speed of a revolving shaft, in rev. per min.; it differs from most appliances of the class in that it is a combination of a clock and a counter, and gives a result that has been averaged over a definite interval. The speed is shown by a pointer, carried loosely on a sleeve, which forms part of a clutch and is driven from a clock train at the rate of one turn per min. The clutch is released momentarily by ratchet gearing, driven from the shaft whose speed is to be observed, and so arranged that the clockwork steadily moves the pointer sleeve while the shaft makes 1200 rev. and then releases it, so that the distance thus travelled by the pointer is greater the lower the speed of the shaft. The pointer and sleeves are, by spiral springs, continually tending to fly back to the starting position when released, and the pointer is also fitted with a brake which retains it over its last reading till it is momentarily released, to permit of its moving into the fresh position should the speed have altered during the last interval. In another and more obvious form of the instrument, the shaft drives the clutch and pointer, while the clockwork releases the clutch at intervals of one minute, the pointer being, however, retained at its last reading as above until the end of the fresh minute.

The mechanism consists of a centrifugal governor, connected, by levers and gearing, to a pointer which moves over a graduated dial. The governor is of the special cosine form patented by Mr. E. Buss in 1876; it is placed with its axis horizontal, and its sliding sleeve is controlled by a weighted lever, outside the casing, which gives a load increasing with the displacement. The governor consists of two semi-cylindrical weights, pivoted by their axes at points some distance from the axis of the shaft. Arms on these weights are directly connected with swivelling bolts attached to the casing, and bears upon a guide plate, which is in contact with rollers mounted on the controlling lever. This form of governor possesses the feature that the pressure on the sleeve is dependent only upon the angular velocity of the shaft, and not upon the position of the parts, so that the pointer will always indicate correctly in spite of any wear that may take place; it is also very stable, a large range of speed being covered between its extreme positions. The driving shaft is carried in a long bearing, upon the outside of which the driving pulley runs, so that no belt pressure is transmitted to the axis of the shaft. The dial is mounted on the top of the casing. The axis of the controlling lever carries another lever which is connected, by a vertical rod, with a shorter lever placed upon the axis of a toothed sector behind the dial, and the sector gears with a pinion on the axis of the pointer; by this arrangement the divisions on the dial are made more uniform.",Inv. 1909-93.,"Continuation from previous page: [FALSE]

The difference in the size of the tube being less than the proportion of the tube being filled with liquid. When in use the diameter of the parabolic air cavity at the top is less than the diameter of the tube, and varies with the speed in such a manner that the vertex of the paraboloid sinks proportionately with the increase in the speed.

Object entry information: This instrument indicates directly on a dial, in rev. per min., the speed at which an engine shaft, etc., to which it is connected by a belt drive, is running. The acting mechanism is of the Buss-Sombart governor type, patented in 1877 (see No. 312), and consists of a spring-loaded pendulum having four cylindrical weights mounted on two rectangular frames, and working on pivots, formed on the revolving spindle. The position assumed by the governor weights under centrifugal action is transmitted to the index pointer by means of two connecting links attached to a movable sleeve inside the tachometer spindle. To damp out oscillations of the pointer when subjected to sudden speed fluctuations, the pointer spindle is fitted with a large gear wheel engaging with a shaft carrying a ""fly"" consisting of a four-armed air vane. The pulley spindle is geared to the tacho-meter spindle in the ratio of 2 : 1, thus obviating inconvenient pulley sizes. The working parts are lubricated by two wick-feed oil-cups. The tachometer is graduated from 600 to 2,400 rev. per min. This example has a glass dial to show the internal parts, and this is supplemented by a sectional illustration.

Object name: RECORDING GYROMETER AND COUNTER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Sir W. H. Bailey & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: This is a combined instrument which indicates the speed of a rotating shaft, counts the number of revolutions, and also makes a permanent record of these quantities on a daily chart. The mechanism is contained within a substantial cast-iron casing, through the side of which the driving spindle projects. The gyrometer, or speed indicator, placed in the lower part of the casing, consists of a centrifugal governor of special form which is very sensitive to changes of speed and at the same time steady. The running parts are of hardened steel and the shafts run in ball bearings. The drive is taken from the rotating shaft to the driving spindle by means of a special tape band, and the range of speed is from 200 to 800 rev. per min. The counter is mounted above the gyrometer and an index moving over a large dial counts from 0 to 1,000 rev.; four small dials carry the readings up to ten millions. On top of the casing a projecting vertical spindle carries a drum which is rotated once in 24 hours by clockwork. A chart is wrapped round the drum and its upper part is ruled with horizontal lines corresponding to the speeds on the gyrometer dial, and with vertical lines showing hours and quarter hours. A pen, moving vertically in unison with the gyrometer needle, draws a line on the chart showing the variation of speed with time. On the lower part of the chart is a ruled space, across which a second vertically moving pen is traversed up and down once for every 10,000 rev. recorded by the counter, thus giving a diagram showing the relation between revolutions and time. A glass-fronted cover encloses the recording mechanism.

Maker/Donor: Lent by E. A. Cowper, Esq.
Date of creation: 1796.
Object entry information: This instrument was introduced by Boulton & Watt in 1796 for the purpose of assisting them in adjusting the valves of a steam engine. In working it there is a diagram of the pressures throughout the stroke of an engine working expansively, but this is clearly the result of calculation. The instrument may have been developed from an apparatus of a pencil to the piston rod and a sheet of paper moved trans-versely to it—features attributed to John Southern, one of Watt's staff—the instrument became a recorder of the pressure existing in the cylinder at every point of the stroke, and gave a diagram from which the work done during the stroke was easily determined.

Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This well-known form of indicator was introduced by Prof. C. B. Richards in 1862, and, except for high-speed engines, is still in use. The great improvement it contained was the employment of a multiplying arrangement by which the stroke of the indicator piston is reduced, and the great distortion of the diagram, through the inertia of the moving parts of the instrument, is generally avoided. The capacity and convenience of the apparatus was also improved in most of the instruments since introduced have followed the methods that Richards invented. The instrument consists of a small cylinder containing a piston held by a spiral spring. A drum is also provided to carry the paper on which the diagram is to be drawn, as in McNaught's instrument, but the paper arm is some little distance from the cylinder. Round the cylinder is fitted a collar with two projecting arms which support the two fixed points of a Watt parallel motion. The parallel point of this motion carries the pencil, and the piston is connected with one of the bridle rods at the point that has only one-fourth of the motion of the piston. Owing to this arrangement, the pencil can be swung round to be in contact with the paper just when desired while the instrument is in action, a feature also of the greatest practical importance. The example is fitted with the detent of Mr. Darke, which is simply a pawl which can at will be allowed to engage in the teeth of a ratchet wheel formed on the drum, and so stop its rotation by preventing its return under the action of the drum spring as the cord slackens.

The motion, under varying pressure, of the free end of the tube is multiplied by a lever in the ratio of about 5:1, and the pencil is constrained to move in a straight line by Watt's parallel motion applied as in Richards indicator. The connection between the tube and the parallel motion is by a rod with ball joints which enables the pencil to be drawn back from the paper on the drum when required. The drum is fitted with a stop motion, consisting of a small lever by which it can be raised sufficiently to disengage a short driving peg attached to the cord pulley.

Owing to this arrangement, the pencil can be swung round to be in contact with the paper just when desired while the instrument is in action, a feature also of the greatest practical importance. The example is fitted with the detent of Mr. Darke, which is simply a pawl which can at will be allowed to engage in the teeth of a ratchet wheel formed on the drum, and so stop its rotation by preventing its return under the action of the drum spring as the cord slackens.

Object entry information: In this steam engine indicator, patented in 1878 by Mr. J. W. Kenyon, a Bourdon tube takes the place of piston and spring. The motion, under varying pressure, of the free end of the tube is multiplied by a lever in the ratio of about 5:1, and the pencil is constrained to move in a straight line by Watt's parallel motion applied as in Richards indicator. The connection between the tube and the parallel motion is by a rod with ball joints which enables the pencil to be drawn back from the paper on the drum when required. The drum is fitted with a stop motion, consisting of a small lever by which it can be raised sufficiently to disengage a short driving peg attached to the cord pulley.

Object entry information: This is a modification of the McNaught indicator (see No. 321) made and used by Mr. G. Scholes for many years while in the employ of James Watt & Co. The improvements in detail due to Mr. Scholes consist in fitting two light steel rods working on short links which hold the pencil out of contact with the card "" until the desired moment; and in addition, a helical spring on the pencil holder to give a predetermined pressure. There are two springs corresponding to 12 lb. and 20 lb. per in. respectively; the scale is graduated to suit 12 lb. on one side and 20 lb. on the other. The cylinder is of gunmetal; it has an area of 0.5 sq. in. with a travel of 3.5 in. The drum is 2 in. diam., and a diagram of about 3 in. by 5 in. can be obtained.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Elliott Bros.
Date of creation: 1888.
Object entry information: This well-known form of indicator was introduced by Prof. C. B. Richards in 1862, and, except for high-speed engines, is still in use. The great improvement it contained was the employment of a multiplying arrangement by which the stroke of the indicator piston is reduced, and the great distortion of the diagram, through the inertia of the moving parts of the instrument, is generally avoided. The capacity and convenience of the apparatus was also improved in most of the instruments since introduced have followed the methods that Richards invented. The instrument consists of a small cylinder containing a piston held by a spiral spring. A drum is also provided to carry the paper on which the diagram is to be drawn, as in McNaught's instrument, but the paper arm is some little distance from the cylinder. Round the cylinder is fitted a collar with two projecting arms which support the two fixed points of a Watt parallel motion. The parallel point of this motion carries the pencil, and the piston is connected with one of the bridle rods at the point that has only one-fourth of the motion of the piston. Owing to this arrangement, the pencil can be swung round to be in contact with the paper just when desired while the instrument is in action, a feature also of the greatest practical importance.

Object entry information: In this modification of the steam-engine indicator, patented by Mr. M. J. Wayne in 1893, a semi-rotary piston is employed to actuate the pencil arm without the intervention of any linkwork. The piston consists of a diametral plate, capable of working steamtight within a cylindrical chamber having two fixed abutments, on opposite sides of which are inlet and outlet ports, as shown in the attached diagram. The indicator spring is of the double helical type, but works in torsion, and resists or measures the action of the steam by checking the rotation of the piston. The outer end of this spring is secured in a groove on the axle of the piston, while the inner end terminates in a brass plate having two holes fitting upon steel pins which project from the cylinder cover and allow the spring to shorten as the torsion is increased, and to allow for the circular path it describes, the diagram paper is held as a cylindrical surface by circular clips concentric with the piston axis and attached to an aluminium sliding frame. A string secured to one end of this frame imparts the reduced motion from the engine piston, and the return motion is obtained by a spring barrel. In the example shown, instead of the usual pencil, a hard steel tracing point is employed marking on black-faced paper. To enable this instrument to obtain a diagram from an engine of exceptionally high speed, without the usual distortion due to the inertia of the moving parts, it is provided with an auxiliary apparatus (shown detached) for taking the diagram in such cases in layers or “limit lines.” This attachment, which can be secured to a horn projecting from the cylinder, consists of a segment of a worm-wheel with a screw.

Object name: CROSBY “NEW” INDICATOR WITH CONTINUOUS DRUM.
Maker/Donor: Presented by the Crosby Steam Gage and Valve Co.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: This indicator, patented by the makers between 1879 and 1907, is generally similar to No. 327, but it has an external spring and is fitted with a special drum for automatically taking a series of diagrams on a continuous strip of paper. This type of drum is very useful where the load varies constantly, as in winding or rolling mill engines, and also when it is desired to take separate diagrams at intervals too short to allow of the card being changed in the ordinary way. The indicator piston has a spherical edge and an area of 1 sq. in.; the pencil connection is made by a small rod fitted inside the hollow piston rod and terminating at its lower end in a ball joint. The piston rod is extended upwards and one end of the spring is clamped to the end of it; the lower end of the spring is fitted to a screwed nose fixed to a bridge piece mounted above the cylinder, and it may be screwed up or down to adjust the position of the pencil. This arrangement removes the springs from the effects of the high temperature and facilitates changing them. The continuous drum is mounted on the indicator arm in place of the ordinary one, and has an external drum 2 in. diam. rotated by a cord and returned by a central helical spring. This drum has a vertical slot in it, within which the roll of paper is mounted on a removable spindle. The paper passes from this roll round outside the drum, and through the slot on to a smaller internal drum, to which its end is clipped; the edges of the slot are provided with anti-friction rollers. The paper is wound on to the central drum by means of two ratchet clutches, one connecting the outer drum with the inner drum and the other connecting the inner drum with the fixed central spindle. The inner clutch holds the central drum stationary for a certain space at the end of each out-stroke of the main drum, so that the latter overruns the inner drum and so winds the paper on to it; this clutch can be so adjusted that the advance of the paper at each revolution of the drum can be regulated to give the desired number of diagrams per foot of paper. The motion of the paper is stopped by throwing out of gear the pawl of the outer ratchet clutch. A fixed pencil is mounted on the drum to continue the atmospheric line on the moving paper. The cord guide of the drum can be set in any position to suit the lead from the engine. The drum takes a roll of paper 2 in. wide and 12 ft. long, and gives a diagram 4 in. long.

Maker/Donor: Presented by the Crosby Steam Gage and Valve Co.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: This indicator, patented by the makers between 1879 and 1907, is generally similar to No. 327, but it has an external spring and is fitted with a special drum for automatically taking a series of diagrams on a continuous strip of paper. This type of drum is very useful where the load varies constantly, as in winding or rolling mill engines, and also when it is desired to take separate diagrams at intervals too short to allow of the card being changed in the ordinary way. The indicator piston has a spherical edge and an area of 1 sq. in.; the pencil connection is made by a small rod fitted inside the hollow piston rod and terminating at its lower end in a ball joint. The piston rod is extended upwards and one end of the spring is clamped to the end of it; the lower end of the spring is fitted to a screwed nose fixed to a bridge piece mounted above the cylinder, and it may be screwed up or down to adjust the position of the pencil. This arrangement removes the springs from the effects of the high temperature and facilitates changing them. The continuous drum is mounted on the indicator arm in place of the ordinary one, and has an external drum 2 in. diam. rotated by a cord and returned by a central helical spring. This drum has a vertical slot in it, within which the roll of paper is mounted on a removable spindle. The paper passes from this roll round outside the drum, and through the slot on to a smaller internal drum, to which its end is clipped; the edges of the slot are provided with anti-friction rollers. The paper is wound on to the central drum by means of two ratchet clutches, one connecting the outer drum with the inner drum and the other connecting the inner drum with the fixed central spindle. The inner clutch holds the central drum stationary for a certain space at the end of each out-stroke of the main drum, so that the latter overruns the inner drum and so winds the paper on to it; this clutch can be so adjusted that the advance of the paper at each revolution of the drum can be regulated to give the desired number of diagrams per foot of paper. The motion of the paper is stopped by throwing out of gear the pawl of the outer ratchet clutch. A fixed pencil is mounted on the drum to continue the atmospheric line on the moving paper.

The application of a mirror as an indicator had been in 1885 by Messrs. Clarke and Low. The indicator is furnished with an elastic diaphragm whose bulging under the varying steam pressure causes a concave mirror to move in a horizontal plane. A beam of light is thrown upon the mirror and reflected on a dark screen placed at a distance from the engine, as shown in the photograph adjacent. Persistence of vision keeps the image on the screen so that it can be traced off by hand or else be photographed; prints of two such exposures are shown. (See Proc. Phys. Soc. XI., 151.)

Object entry information: An arm extending from the indicator connection supports a horizontal spindle running in ball bearings and carrying a pulley, round which the indicator cord is wrapped and secured. A vertical spindle is fixed below the arm and carries a light pulley, round which is wrapped another cord, the end of which is connected with the engine crosshead. The two pulleys are connected by bevel gearing with a ratio of 3 : 1, and the horizontal spindle is rotated against the action of an adjustable helical spring contained in a projecting casing. The upper or stroke pulley consists of a number of movable concentric rings by means of which its diameter may be varied to suit different engine strokes from 14 in. to 72 in.; this pulley is connected with the spindle through a clutch which allows the pulley to be held stationary by means of a spring detent, so that the motion of the indicator may be stopped when desired. The lower drum is fitted with a moving guide for properly coiling the cord.

Object entry information: This steam indicator of the mirror-reflecting type was invented by Prof. John Perry, F.R.S., and described by him before the Physical Society in 1891. The application of a mirror as an indicator had been in 1885 by Messrs. Clarke and Low. The indicator is furnished with an elastic diaphragm whose bulging under the varying steam pressure causes a concave mirror to move in a horizontal plane. A beam of light is thrown upon the mirror and reflected on a dark screen placed at a distance from the engine, as shown in the photograph adjacent. Persistence of vision keeps the image on the screen so that it can be traced off by hand or else be photographed; prints of two such exposures are shown. (See Proc. Phys. Soc. XI., 151.)

Object entry information: This is a special form of planimeter arranged for measuring indicator diagrams. Starting from a point in the toe of the diagram, and with the measuring wheel at zero, the tracing point is led round the diagram, and with the completing the circuit, the fresh reading on the wheel is the area of the diagram in square inches. By now sliding the tracing point vertically up the diagram, until the measuring wheel again reads zero, a height is obtained equivalent to the mean ordinate, and when measured with the indicator scale gives the average mean pressure throughout the stroke.

PXL_20251126_152105486.jpg,339.,MODEL OF HAYSTACK BOILER. (Scale 1:12.),Made in the Museum from particulars supplied by the Coalbrookdale Co.,1907.,"This type of boiler, which together with its setting was only an adaptation of existing practice with brewers’ pans and spirit stills, was used throughout the 18th century for supplying steam to atmospheric engines; under the name of the “balloon” boiler it survived in the Staffordshire district till late in the 19th century. The period represented by the model is about the middle of that century. At first it was the practice to place the boiler vertically under the engine cylinder, but about 1760, as the power of engines was increasing, the demand for more steam was met by an increase in the number of the boilers, placed in contiguous settings, rather than in their size. The boiler was under-fired and set in masonry or brickwork, so that the hot gases made a complete circuit of the sides on their way to the chimney in a way known as a “wheel draught.” As the pressure used was practically only that of the atmosphere, the question of construction was subsidiary to that of heating surface; accordingly we find that the flange boiler, which was the type used with the earliest Newcomen engines, had the side flue formed by a horizontal flange uniting vertical sides to a base plate. Later a slight improvement was made by adopting conical or concave sides, hence the name “haystack.” The bottom was at one time recessed so as to form a spiral flue, as patented in 1748 by Thomas Stephens and Moses Hadley, but generally it was flat or concave. Internal stays were but rarely used, and instances of boilers up to 15 ft. diam. without them are recorded. The numerous explosions that had been traced to these defects in shape and construction and the low ratio of heating surface to cubic contents possible, led to the disuse of this type of boiler. The material of which the boiler was made was at first copper, often with lead for the top; the corners appear to have been made by flanging the plates. On account of their durability and less cost, wrought-iron plates produced by hammering seem to have been substituted as early as 1725. Cast iron was also used; even in 1776 Smeaton preferred this material for his boilers. It was not till about 1790 that plates and other sections produced by rolling became generally available. The feed water was introduced through a valve controlled by hand into a cistern on a vertical stand-pipe by which a column of water of sufficient height to balance the pressure within was obtained. The water level was indicated by the position of a lever connected with a float inside. The blow-off pipe was usually stopped simply by a wooden plug. The model represents a boiler 11 ft. high by 12 ft. diam. at the dome, decreasing to 10 ft. diam. at the bottom. The grate area is 25 sq. ft., the heating surface 235 sq. ft., the water space about 550 cub. ft., and the steam space 300 cub. ft. The pressure would not exceed 3 lb. per sq. in.",Inv. 1907-14.

Object entry information: Sustained efforts have been made to improve combustion of fuel by increasing the number of spaces between fire bars without diminution of area (see Nos. 366-368), or by forming the grate as series of steps (see No. 344), so as to get more intimate contact between the incoming air and the fuel. The prevention of admission of excess of cold air or the warming of air for combustion by otherwise waste heat and its supply under pressure are devices successfully adopted. The provision of a firebrick arch in water-tube boilers or a combustion air-chamber, especially in connection with pulverised fuel (see No. 381), to obviate any but incandescent gases striking the boiler surfaces is now usual.

Object entry information: This is an experimental model of a boiler patented by Mr. H. S. Coleman in 1876, consisting of two horizontal shells fixed vertically above each other and connected by seven large necks. By a long internal tube in each alternate neck, communication is made between the bottom of the upper shell and the lower portion of the lower one. When in action, the water heated in the lower vessel rises through the necks, while the cooler water circulates downward through the internal tubes. The steam generated forms in the upper portion of the top chamber, and then passes into a small separating vessel fixed at the top. Glass ends have been fitted by which the circulation of the water can be observed. The boiler is mounted in a metal setting provided with two side doors, through which the heating surfaces can be cleaned. Between the two shells two horizontal plates are fitted, the lower one leaving a space at one end of the boiler and the upper one leaving a space at the opposite end, thus forming flues through which the gases from the furnace below pass backward and forward and backward again before reaching the chimney.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Jeremiah Head, Esq.,
Date of creation: 1876.
Object entry information: By this method of supporting a long boiler, patented by Mr. Head in 1870, the ends may rise and fall by expansion without altering the position of the points of support, thus reducing the stresses that frequently cause seam-rips. The boiler represented is of the long egg-ended type set in an ordinary brick setting, such as is still used in iron works. Pieces of T iron are riveted to the boiler and attached by suspension rods to weighted levers, with their fulcra carried on cast-iron bridges, two intermediate bridges, however, carrying suspension rods fixed by nuts. The steam connections are fitted with double bends or U pipes. By a hand wheel on the model the boiler may be curved so as to show the action of these supports.

Object entry information: This is an experimental model of a boiler patented by Mr. H. S. Coleman in 1876, consisting of two horizontal shells fixed vertically above each other and connected by seven large necks. By a long internal tube in each alternate neck, communication is made between the bottom of the upper shell and the lower portion of the lower one. When in action, the water heated in the lower vessel rises through the necks, while the cooler water circulates downward through the internal tubes. The steam generated forms in the upper portion of the top chamber, and then passes into a small separating vessel fixed at the top. Glass ends have been fitted by which the circulation of the water can be observed. The boiler is mounted in a metal setting provided with two side doors, through which the heating surfaces can be cleaned. Between the two shells two horizontal plates are fitted, the lower one leaving a space at one end of the boiler and the upper one leaving a space at the opposite end, thus forming flues through which the gases from the furnace below pass backward and forward and backward again before reaching the chimney.

Object entry information: Watt about 1780-90, and remained in general use till about 1850, when the gradual increase that had taken place in boiler pressures led to its abandonment through the inherent weakness of its shape. The boiler usually had a semi-cylindrical top with concave bottom and sides, and was set over the furnace, from which the gases, after passing along the bottom of the boiler, returned along one side flue, and then passed back again by the other side flue, following the course known as a ""wheel draught."" At a later period a nearly square central flue through the boiler was introduced, and the gases from the furnace, after passing under the bottom, returned through this flue, dividing at the front, so that one-half of the quantity passed along each of the side flues, thus originating what is known as the ""split draught."" The feed water was introduced by a vertical stand-pipe, or ""feed-head,"" of sufficient height to prevent water being blown out of it by the steam pressure. In this pipe was a float connected with a damper in the main flue, so that if the pressure fell, the rate of combustion was automatically increased; the feed water was supplied to the head from a cistern provided with a valve controlled by a float within the boiler. The boiler represented was of 20 nominal h.p. It was 13.8 ft. long, 6.8 ft. high, 5.33 ft. wide at the water line, and had a heating surface of 200 sq. ft., a grate area of 29 sq. ft., and ordinarily contained 300 cub. ft. of water, and had a steam space of 115 cub. ft.

Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. Galloways, Ltd., 1894.
Date of creation: 1894
Object entry information: This represents in section a Lancashire boiler of the “ Galloway ” type. Two furnaces 2·8 ft. diam. unite in one flattened tube 4·6 ft. wide and 2·75 ft. high, forming a combustion chamber which is the feature of the Galloway boiler. To give the necessary resistance to the collapsing pressure, thirty-three Galloway water tubes are introduced, the shape of which the flanges are perpendicular to the length. To deflect the gases amongst the tubes, four water pockets are inserted in the sides of the shell. The furnace flues are welded longitudinally and united transversely by the Adamson flanged joint (see No. 346). The shell is in rings, each of a single plate, lap-jointed and double riveted, and the ends are each of a single plate. The front end is secured to the shell by a welded angle ring and gussets, and the back end by flanging it over and by the use of gusset stays. A 4-in. dead-weight safety-valve is fitted, and also a combined high-steam and low-water safety-valve. The actual boiler is 28 ft. long by 7 ft. diam., and is capable of evaporating 6,000 lb. of water per hour, giving 300 h.p. with a good engine.

Maker/Donor: Prepared in the Museum from information supplied by Messrs. Holdsworth & Sons, Ltd., 1920.
Date of creation: 1920
Object entry information: This shows a type of boiler patented by Mr. W. H. Casmey in 1906. It differs from the Lancashire boiler in that the flues incline upward, and increase in diameter from front to back.
This construction has the effect of gradually reducing the quantity of water surrounding the flues and increasing the heating surface as the temperature of the furnace gases falls, thus giving a more uniform generation of steam throughout. It is claimed that a Yorkshire boiler may be considerably smaller than a Lancashire boiler of equal power.
The boiler shell is 24 ft. long and 9 ft. 4 in. diam., and has two flues, which are 41·25 in. diam. at the furnace end and 45·2 in. at the back end. The axes of the flues rise 5 in. from front to back. The shell is formed of four rings, each a single plate, joined by double-riveted lap joints. The longitudinal joints are treble-riveted butt joints with double straps. Each flue is built up of 10 short lengths of welded tube united by Adamson flanged joints. The boiler ends are single plates, the front one being joined to the shell by an angle ring, while the rear one is flanged round the edge. Each end is stiffened and tied to the shell by seven gusset plates. Details of the joints and seats for the various fittings are shown.

Object name: MODEL OF COCHRAN MULTITUBULAR BOILER. (Scale 1:2)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Cochran & Co.
Date of creation: 1881.
Object entry information: This design originated from an idea of Mr. Edward Crompton for embodying some features of the horizontal multitubular boiler in a vertical boiler; he and Mr. J. T. Cochran patented the invention subsequently in 1878. The firebox is of hemispherical form, so as to avoid flat surfaces which have to be stayed. From the firebox the burning gases escape through a circular opening to a combustion chamber above, and from thence pass through a number of short horizontal tubes into the smokebox on the opposite side, from which they escape into the chimney. It is found that these short tubes are much more efficient than their limited length and surface would suggest. The boiler is built of mild steel, and the model shows fully the details of the method of construction adopted. To prevent radiation of heat from the combustion chamber a fire-brick lining is fitted, and to facilitate cleaning the tubes the smokebox is provided with hinged doors. In the model the surfaces in contact with the water are coloured dark blue, and those with the hot gases red. A modified form of this boiler is shown in the Marine Engineering Section.

The shell is cylindrical with a domed top containing the manhole; the firebox is in the form of an oblique cone, fitting the shell at the bottom and inclining to the back, where it is connected with the base of a cylindrical combustion chamber having a dished top. These forms avoid the use of stays and therefore facilitate cleaning. The combustion chamber is completely surrounded by water, and from its front seventy horizontal fire tubes extend radially to the shell which is bossed out, where necessary, to receive normally those tubes which would pierce it obliquely. The grate is fired through a short oval tube connecting the firebox with the shell, while the smokebox, which is attached to the shell higher up and carries the chimney base, is provided with hinged doors for use when cleaning the tubes. A separate mid-length section of the boiler shows an alternative arrangement of the combustion chamber and tubes. The chamber has a domed top and cylindrical back, which is stayed to the shell; the tube plate is flat, as is also the corresponding portion of the shell plating, so that the fire tubes are of uniform length and parallel; there are seventy-seven of these tubes, of which fourteen are provided with nuts so that they serve as stay-tubes.

Object name: MODEL OF COCHRAN MULTITUBULAR BOILER. (Scale 1:2)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Cochran & Co.
Date of creation: 1881.
Object entry information: This design originated from an idea of Mr. Edward Crompton for embodying some features of the horizontal multitubular boiler in a vertical boiler; he and Mr. J. T. Cochran patented the invention subsequently in 1878. The firebox is of hemispherical form, so as to avoid flat surfaces which have to be stayed. From the firebox the burning gases escape through a circular opening to a combustion chamber above, and from thence pass through a number of short horizontal tubes into the smokebox on the opposite side, from which they escape into the chimney. It is found that these short tubes are much more efficient than their limited length and surface would suggest. The boiler is built of mild steel, and the model shows fully the details of the method of construction adopted. To prevent radiation of heat from the combustion chamber a fire-brick lining is fitted, and to facilitate cleaning the tubes the smokebox is provided with hinged doors. In the model the surfaces in contact with the water are coloured dark blue, and those with the hot gases red. A modified form of this boiler is shown in the Marine Engineering Section.

Object name: MODELS OF BLAKE’S MULTITUBULAR VERTICAL BOILER. (Scale 1: 12.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Richardsons, Westgarth and Co.
Date of creation: 1901.
Object entry information: The construction of vertical boiler embodies several arrangements patented by Mr. J. Blake between 1878–97. The shell is cylindrical with a domed top containing the manhole; the firebox is in the form of an oblique cone, fitting the shell at the bottom and inclining to the back, where it is connected with the base of a cylindrical combustion chamber having a dished top. These forms avoid the use of stays and therefore facilitate cleaning. The combustion chamber is completely surrounded by water, and from its front seventy horizontal fire tubes extend radially to the shell which is bossed out, where necessary, to receive normally those tubes which would pierce it obliquely. The grate is fired through a short oval tube connecting the firebox with the shell, while the smokebox, which is attached to the shell higher up and carries the chimney base, is provided with hinged doors for use when cleaning the tubes. A separate mid-length section of the boiler shows an alternative arrangement of the combustion chamber and tubes. The chamber has a domed top and cylindrical back, which is stayed to the shell; the tube plate is flat, as is also the corresponding portion of the shell plating, so that the fire tubes are of uniform length and parallel; there are seventy-seven of these tubes, of which fourteen are provided with nuts so that they serve as stay-tubes.

Date of creation: 1903.
Object entry information: The larger model shows an arrangement of boiler patented in 1898 by Mr. J. B. Furneaux. The shell is cylindrical with a closed segmental top, and the firebox is a truncated cone surmounted by a vertical cylindrical combustion chamber having a dished top. The cone is crossed by a large inclined water-tube, while from one side of the combustion chamber 130 fire tubes, arranged in vertical rows, extend radially to the shell. The ends of some of the tubes are contracted by ferrules to ensure equal distribution of the gases, which pass through them to an external smokebox carrying the funnel and provided with sliding doors to facilitate tube cleaning. Three small ports in the shell, admit warm air directly into the combustion chamber to prevent the discharge of smoke or unconsumed gases. The shell of the boiler is extended downward to form the sides of the ash pan; the grate, however, is not shown. The smaller model represents a modification of this arrangement patented in 1899 by Messrs. J. B. Furneaux and W. A. Woodison. The combustion chamber

Date of creation: Patented 1825; Constructed 1826.
Object entry information: For the purposes of his steam carriage Sir Goldsworthy Gurney patented, in 1825, a water-tube boiler which he modified subsequently, as shown, for stationary use. This boiler was constructed in 1826 at his manufactory at Regent’s Basin. It was tested there in 1827 by Mr. Simon Goodrich on behalf of the Navy Office, but his report was unfavourable. The boiler was made of wrought-iron pipes bent to a C shape, the ends being screwed and held by nuts in cast-iron horizontal headers joined by downcomers. The headers were joined by bends to a vertical steam “ separator ” of wrought iron strengthened by hoops. This was provided with gauge cocks and a lever safety valve. The lower legs of the pipes formed the grate and brick baffles were inserted to make the course of the gases circuitous. Lightness, ease of repair and rapidity in getting up steam were claimed as the advantages but difficulties with materials were met with, e.g., pipes at that time were lapwelded and in lengths of not more than 6 ft. Probably the circulation was defective ; anyhow the boiler did not survive. The heating surface of this boiler was about 60 sq. ft., and the grate area 5·6 sq. ft. ; the content of water was 160 lb. The time required to get up steam from the coal was 14 min. The evaporation was 6·7 lb. water per lb. of good Newcastle coal at 60 lb. pressure.

Maker/Donor: Lent by J. Harrison, Esq., 1862.
Date of creation: Patented 1859.
Object entry information: This steam generator was patented in 1859 by Mr. Joseph Harrison of Philadelphia. It consists of a large number of communicating globular iron chambers, cast in sets of four ; the ends of each set are machined so that tight joints can be made when several sets are held together by internal tie-rods. In this way the cells are connected into slabs, while by suitable castings and tie-rods a number of these slabs are similarly united to form a complete boiler of the requisite heating surface. The slabs are arranged with a slope of 25 deg. in a brickwork chamber, the furnace being at the lower end and the steam pipe at the top, while suitable bridges distribute the gases between the nests of cells. About one-third of the cell capacity is used as steam space, and in it a certain degree of drying or superheating is effected. Exceptional portability and adaptability were claimed for the arrangement, as well as great safety, owing to the smallness of the individual elements of which the generator is built up. The boiler has since been somewhat modified, and as now constructed is given a slope of 40 deg. with the horizontal. On trial it was found that one of these generators, when tested to 875 lb. steam pressure, leaked considerably at the joints, but that it became tight again upon the pressure dropping to 450 lb. In some forms of sectional tubulous boilers the use of internal tie-rods has given trouble owing to the expansion of the external tube being greater than that of the rod.

Object entry information: This type of water-tube boiler was patented in 1889 by Mr. A. Stirling; a complete boiler and one in section are shown.
The boiler consists of a number of groups of steeply-inclined tubes, expanded at their upper ends into three cylindrical steam and water chambers, and at their lower ends into two cylindrical mud drums, in which the water, being comparatively quiet, deposits its sediment. The feed water is admitted to the upper chamber farthest removed from the fire, and this chamber contains the automatic float for regulating the water level. The tubes leading thence to the mud drum serve as downcomers for the water passing to other sections of the boiler and, in heating the feed water, act somewhat like those of an economiser. The sides, roof, and floor of the boiler are of brickwork, but the weight of the boiler is carried, and the walls supported, by a steel framing. There is a brick arch above the furnace, which assists in directing the flames towards the tubes, and between the groups of tubes are baffles, formed of fireclay slabs, arranged so as to cause the hot gases to traverse the whole of the tube surface before reaching the chimney through the damper door at the back. Through the side wall there are protected openings which give access for the scraping tools used in cleaning the exterior of the tubes. The steam generated is withdrawn from a steam dome fixed upon the central chamber, into which the steam from the wing chambers is led by curved horizontal pipes, an arrangement which, it is stated, conduces to dryness in the steam.
The complete boiler represented is of the middle size constructed, and has 56 sq. ft. of grate area, 2,900 sq. ft. of heating surface, and would supply about 12,000 lb. of steam per hour at a pressure of 160 lb., giving about 600 h.p. with a suitable engine.

Object entry information: This is an example of the double water tube for steam boilers, patented in 1862, by Mr. E. Field and Messrs. M. and R. M. Merryweather. By them it was applied to the boilers of steam fire-engines, in which lightness and rapid steaming are of great importance. This was the first practical application of an internal tube within a heated one for separating the currents of hot and cold water from one another.
The arrangement consists of an inner and outer tube—the outer one, which is closed through its lower end being welded into a hemispherical shape, has its upper end expanded into the tube plate so that its exterior is exposed to the fire or hot gases; the inner tube is open at both ends and its upper end is provided with an enlarged mouthpiece, which projects above the tube plate into the water space and has three external fins supporting it centrally within the outer tube.
The water between the two tubes, becoming heated and giving off steam, rapidly rises and is replaced by cold water which flows downward through the central tube; the enlarged mouthpiece acts as a deflector in reducing priming, and also facilitates the entry of water into the downcoming tube. In the Niclausse boiler and other developments of the concentric tube arrangement the rising and downcoming tubes open into separate chambers to avoid any interference between the ascending and descending currents.

The arrangement consists of an inner and outer tube—the outer one, which is closed through its lower end being welded into a hemispherical shape, has its upper end expanded into the tube plate so that its exterior is exposed to the fire or hot gases; the inner tube is open at both ends and its upper end is provided with an enlarged mouthpiece, which projects above the tube plate into the water space and has three external fins supporting it centrally within the outer tube.
The water between the two tubes, becoming heated and giving off steam, rapidly rises and is replaced by cold water which flows downward through the central tube; the enlarged mouthpiece acts as a deflector in reducing priming, and also facilitates the entry of water into the downcoming tube. In the Niclausse boiler and other developments of the concentric tube arrangement the rising and downcoming tubes open into separate chambers to avoid any interference between the ascending and descending currents.
A drawing of a Field boiler (scale 1:4) shows the arrangement of the tubes.

In this class of water-tube boiler the heating surface is formed by tubes closed at one end and opening at the other into square vertical water chambers, or ""headers,"" while within each tube is a smaller one conveying cooler water from another chamber in the header to the closed end—each double tube acting similarly to the tubes introduced by Mr. E. Field in 1862. The application of the internal circulating tube to the inclined tubes of boilers of the water-tube type was first achieved by M. Collet, who also introduced the double-chambered header, but the attachment of the outer tubes he, however, employed long internal bolts, and these proved to be unsatisfactory. The practical success of the arrangement is, therefore, due to the work of M. M. Niclausse, who invented and patented, between 1891 and 1900, a form of joint for this purpose which has overcome the difficulties and led to the successful introduction of this system of construction (see also Marine Engineering Collection).
The model shows, partly in section, a Niclausse boiler having a brick setting. The boiler consists of groups of slightly inclined tubes, closed at the back ends and connected at the front in double vertical rows of headers, which themselves open at the top into a collecting drum or chamber—each double row with its an outer portion of its header, which also communicates with the collecting drum, so that water from the drum may pass down the headers and through the central passage between the two tubes and up the steam generated, return through the passage between the two tubes and up the steam generated, return through the headers again into the drum, without the two streams mixing or interfering. The water level is above the bottom of the drum, and a dividing plate separates the hotter water from the cooler portion, including the feed water. There is, however, no lower water chamber, so that this form of boiler cannot be completely emptied without removing the tubes.
The method of attaching the tubes to the headers consists in the employment of a special sleeve or “lantern,” passing through the header and fitting it by means of coned surfaces, while the smaller end is screwed to receive the outer tube. The lantern of the inner tube screws into the outer lantern, and dogs outside the headers keep the conical surfaces in contact, little retaining pressure being, however, required owing to the areas nearly balancing.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Babcock & Wilcox, 1903 and 1912.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This construction of water-tube steam generator was first patented and introduced in the U.S.A. in 1867 by Mr. S. Wilcox and Mr. G. H. Babcock, and has since undergone considerable modification and development. Plate VIII, No. 1.
The boiler now consists of groups of straight water-tubes arranged over the grate and inclining downwards at 15 deg. into the chamber or flue beyond. The upper ends of these tubes open into special vertical tubes or “headers,” connected above to a horizontal drum in which the steam and water rising from the tubes separate; the space within the drum above the water level acts also as the chamber or dome from which the steam is drawn off. The lower ends of the water tubes are similarly connected to the other end of the drum, while the lower ends of these rear headers communicate with a small transverse mud-drum serving as a mud chamber. These downcomers and headers allow water from the separating drum to descend to the lower ends of the tubes, to replace the water carried up as steam, or with it, thus maintaining complete circulation; and allow the solid impurities to a large extent precipitate in the mud-drum, during the downward passage of the water through the rear headers.
The model represents a boiler having 49 inclined water-tubes, 4 in. diam. and 14 ft. long, made of wrought mild steel. They are expanded at each end into the headers, also of wrought mild steel, each containing one zigzag row of tubes, to accommodate which the sides of the headers are sinuous. For cleaning purposes these headers are provided with handholes opposite each water-tube, the handhole covers being faced metal to metal, and secured by wrought steel clamps. The tops of the headers are attached to the steam and

The mud-drum is made of cast metal, or of wrought mild steel, and is connected to the rear headers by short expanded tubes.
STOKER.
Firing is done by hand on a fixed grate or by an automatic stoker. The one shown is of the chain grate type embodying several improvements made by the firm. The travelling chains are formed of links supported on rollers and actuated by sprockets from an eccentric and ratchet from an eccentric on an overhead shaft. The sprockets are adjustable in channels so that it can be drawn back bodily from the furnace front. It is carried on the grate. The hopper is independent, being secured to the furnace front. It is fitted with a sliding door to regulate the depth of fuel carried on the grate. There is a flap which can be hooked back when it is desired to stoke by hand. At the far end of the grate is an ash plate with renewable nose, and beyond it a dumping door worked by worm and quadrant. The entire boiler is suspended, so that it can expand or contract without any strain being thrown on the surrounding brickwork, by wrought iron slings from rolled joints resting on iron columns. Two fire-brick baffles arranged among the tubes cause the hot gases from the furnace, under the influence of the chimney draught, to take a sinuous course which, together with the arrangement of the tubes, ensures a large amount of direct impact by the gases. The damper is placed in the rear wall, and the doors for cleaning the tubes and removing the soot are in the side walls, while the front is rendered accessible by two iron doors. The boiler is fitted with the usual mountings, comprising main steam stop-valve, safety-valve, feed-valve, blow-off valve, water gauges, and steam pressure gauge. The boiler represented contains about 900 sq. ft. of heating surface, which would be capable of evaporating from 3,000 to 3,500 lb. of water per hour ; such boilers can be constructed for any pressure not exceeding 500 lb. per sq. in. ; about 200 lb. is, however, the most usual.
SUPERHEATER.
The model shows also the Babcock and Wilcox steam superheater as arranged in such a boiler, to heat the steam generated beyond the boiler temperature, and so reduce the subsequent losses in the steam engine. This superheater is placed in the space between the drum and the inclined tubes and consists of 4 groups of 6 solid drawn steel tubes 1.5 in. diam. bent into U form, arranged horizontally, and expanded at their ends into two wrought steel boxes or “manifolds,” provided opposite the tubes with inspection handholes. The steam from the boiler drum passes down from a collecting pipe into the upper manifold, then through the superheater tubes into the lower manifold, from each end of which it passes by pipes leading to the stop-valve. To prevent injury to the superheater tubes when steam is being raised from a cold boiler, an arrangement is provided for flooding them with water. This consists of a connection with the water space of the boiler drum and two cocks, by opening the larger of which the water is admitted to the superheater but any steam formed rises directly to the boiler drum. When steam has been got up, before opening the boiler to the steam main, the large cock is closed and the small one is opened so that the water in the superheater drains away, a gauge glass being provided to show that the draining is completed. The chimney represented is 30 in. diam., by 60 ft. high, and is composed of wrought iron plates 1/8 in. thick, riveted together, and is secured to a bolted down cast iron base and is stayed by steel wire guy ropes.","Inv. 1913-645, 25,534, S.M. 392.","Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object entry information: This form of steam generator, although invented many years ago, did not come into extensive use until it was taken up by Léon Serpollet in 1887, subsequently improved by him, and applied to steam carriages. In it superheated steam is instantaneously generated from small quantities of water pumped into heated tubes, regulation being effected by varying the quantity of water injected according to the demand for steam. The boiler is peculiarly suitable for motor cars, as it can be made very small for a given power, and generates steam at high pressure without being liable to danger from explosion.

Object entry information: The beneficial action of a large volume of water in a steam boiler, in moderating the fluctuations in steam pressure consequent upon variations in the work being done, has long been known, while the practicability of running locomotives for moderate distances solely with the steam obtainable from a reservoir of highly heated water, has been repeatedly demonstrated on tramways and in mines. The thermal storage system employed by Mr. Halpin, while depending upon the same principles as these earlier arrangements, forms a somewhat different application. In the method he patented in 1891–2, which was primarily designed to overcome the difficulties experienced in electric light stations through the great variations in the work required from the plant at various times, the excess of heat received by the boilers when the engine demand for steam is slight is stored in a reservoir of hot water, suitably lagged with non-conducting covering. The reservoir is a vertical cylindrical vessel 30 ft. high by 8 ft. diam., greater capacity when necessary being secured by increasing the number of such vessels. The boiler and reservoir pressures are higher than that at which the steam is supplied to the engine, and the thermal storage is represented by the difference in the amount of heat in the reservoir at the temperatures corresponding with the higher and lower pressures respectively. With pressures of 250 lb. and 115 lb. absolute it is estimated that each pound of water originally in the reservoir will supply 0.07 lb. of steam at the lower pressure, which steam is thus available to assist the boilers at the time when the engine demand exceeds their supplying capacity; furthermore, water from the reservoir can be directly admitted to the boiler so that the feed can at the same time be shut off. When, moreover, through steam having been withdrawn, the temperature and pressure of the reservoir have fallen, the mass of cooler water it contains is capable of condensing steam from the boiler and thereby storing heat when, through a reduction in the demand, the boilers are supplying more steam than is being required. These lithographs, however, show a modification of the apparatus patented by Mr. Halpin in 1901, in which a storage reservoir or drum is placed on the top of a horizontal boiler and connected with its shell by a tube of large area which extends nearly to the top of the drum, both vessels being at the same pressure. The feed water, from an injector or pump, is introduced at the top of the drum wherein, as it becomes heated nearly to the steam pressure, it deposits its sediment thus saving incrustation in the boiler itself. This hot water, taken from above the sediment level, is afterwards allowed to flow into the boiler as feed when an exceptional load comes on, the injector feed being shut off so as to increase the steaming power. By placing the boiler and reservoir one connection within another only one opening in the shell is required.

When it is opened for stoking the fire it is turned up so as to stand full open, opening outward; but when it is desired to admit air above the grate to prevent smoke after putting on fresh coal, the door can be set open a little way opening inward, in which position its curved surface acts as a deflector, driving the inflowing air down upon the ""dead-plate"" in front of the grate, so that it shall impinge upon the fuel.

Object entry information: This shows a boiler furnace for utilising dust or refuse fuel by the assistance of forced draught. It was patented by M. Perret in 1881. The fire bars are made very deep, and their lower edges dip into a water trough below, by which means the bars are kept comparatively cool. An outside cistern with a ball-cock automatically maintains the height of water in the trough, and a small box outside the furnace has a testing hole at the top through which the height of the water can be ascertained. The forced blast, which is regulated by a throttle valve, is supplied to the closed ashpit at a pressure of 0·5 in. to 1 in. of water, and passes upward through the fuel. The cooling of the bars prevents the adherence of clinker, and their lower outline avoids the trouble that would otherwise result in casting owing to the varying section.

Object entry information: This shows a furnace, suitable for burning fuel of low calorific value by means of forced draught, provided also with an arrangement for preventing smoke; it is shown fitted to a Cornish boiler, but can be applied to any type. The grate is made up, according to the nature of the fuel, either of closely spaced bars or of plate of channel section perforated with a large number of conical holes or slots. Each plate or set of bars forms the cover of a trough into which air is forced by a steam jet of adjustable rectangular cross-section. The steam pipe leading to the jets has a pressure gauge, and a stop valve to throttle the steam to the most economical pressure. The small quantity of ash falling through the holes into the trough is removed by a rake of special form. Each section being independently controlled, its efficiency is unaffected by the thickness of the fuel elsewhere in the furnace. To prevent smoke, a heated current of air is directed by an independently controlled steam jet above the door down upon the gases rising from the fuel near the bridge. It is stated that with this furnace upwards of 60 lb. of fuel can be burnt per sq. ft. per hour with greater evaporative efficiency than with natural draught, after allowing for the steam used by the jets.

Alternate spigots are interrupted to allow air to pass upwards through a recess tapering in two directions so as to form with the adjacent bar a narrow slit on the top surface. The remaining holes communicate with a hollow bridge. The bars have feet which rest on the flues. Two examples are shown, (a) for a stationary boiler, forced draught, and (b) for a locomotive boiler, induced draught; the latter has only one set of holes. It is claimed that these bars will burn small coal, etc., remain cool and not clinker, thus giving considerable economy in fuel.

Object entry information: This arrangement of water tubes for the internal flues of cylindrical or shell boilers was patented in 1901–3 by Mr. W. McG. Greaves. About half the flue rings situated nearest the back end of the boiler are modified by having flats pressed upon so as to take a nest of solid drawn tubes 2 to 3 in. diam. placed vertically across the flue, leaving segmental spaces on either side; these tubes are expanded in place. In a Lancashire boiler of ordinary proportions an increase of heating surface of about 70 per cent. over plain flues and about 20 per cent. over Galloway tubes is obtained. Increased evaporation and efficiency as compared with both the above flues are claimed.

These flues are made as plain cylinders, and then corrugated by rolling or by swageing, short cylindrical ends being left for making the necessary joints. The corrugations stiffen and strengthen the tube against collapse in the same way that a plate of metal used as a column would be strengthened if rolled with the Z section, so increasing the least moment of inertia.

In the other model the gases pass, from the furnace, along the bottom of the boiler, then return by one side flue, and finally proceed to the chimney by an opposite side flue, following a ""wheel draught"" (see No. 339). Air which has been heated while passing through brick flues formed in the surface walls is delivered at the bridge to complete the combustion of the gases from the furnace; this device was practically tested with some success in 1810 by Mr. John Wakefield, and has since been frequently re-invented.

Object entry information: The feature of the firebox, introduced by Messrs. Garrett in 1876, is the means by which the roof is prevented from collapsing under internal pressure. The usual flat roof and girder stays are dispensed with. The crown sheet is corrugated longitudinally and also has a camber in a direction at right angles to the corrugations given to it, thus constituting it a girder of considerable depth and one possessing the desired strength and stiffness. The crown plate was at first made with three corrugations, but in 1879 it was made as shown, a construction which provides a deep water pocket in the hottest part of the furnace. It is claimed that the durability of the firebox is increased owing to the freedom for expansion permitted by this system of construction. The flat sides are supported as is usual by screwed and riveted stays. The modern method of construction in which, to obviate the use of angle irons and their attendant riveting, the plates are flanged over while hot, is shown.

Maker/Donor: Samson Fox, Esq. (Lent by)
Date of creation: 1879
Object entry information: These show the form of furnace flue patented by Mr. Fox in 1877. The plain cylindrical furnace subjected to collapsing pressure showed its instability as pressures increased, and many devices were resorted to for the purpose of preventing its distortion and consequent collapse. Mr. Fox's invention has been very extensively adopted, and it is claimed that, in addition to the increased strength obtained, the flue will easily alter in length without requiring any separate expansion rings, and has also an increased heating surface. These flues are made as plain cylinders, and then corrugated by rolling or by swageing, short cylindrical ends being left for making the necessary joints. The corrugations stiffen and strengthen the tube against collapse in the same way that a plate of metal used as a column would be strengthened if rolled with the Z section, so increasing the least moment of inertia. Galloway tubes corrugated longitudinally are also shown.

Object entry information: These show an improved form of the mechanical stoker patented in 1841 by Mr. John Juckes, which, although most generally applied to under-fired boilers, has also been successfully used with those of the through furnace flue class and of the water-tube type.
The chief feature of the furnace is that the fire bars are in short lengths and pinned together, so as to form the links of a wide pitch chain which is moved by sprocket wheels at an adjustable rate, by ratchet and reduction gearing from an external source of power. The top surface of this travelling grate is maintained level by a series of transverse carrying rollers, and the sag of the lower return portion is restricted in the same way, while the wear of the links can be taken up by adjusting screws which move the bearings of the inner sprocket wheels.
The fuel is contained in a hopper at the front, from which it falls on to the in-going portion of the grate, the depth of fuel thus let in being regulated by an adjustable sliding door. The first portion of the furnace is covered by a low firebrick arch which heats the in-going coal and drives off the most volatile gases, so that they shall be consumed by passing over the full length of the fire. The whole grate and its supports are carried on a truck which can be moved in or out on rails when, as in the case of the brewery copper shown, the fire has to be withdrawn upon the completion of a boil while the charge is being drawn off and a fresh one introduced. This class of furnace is practically smokeless, even when using inferior fuel, and it gives a high evaporative efficiency. The furnace represented is for heating a copper 21 ft. diam. and has a grate area of 55.5 sq. ft. ; the gases pass round the boiler through flues which give a split draught, and then escape to a chimney, which is shown supported on rolled joists and provided with sliding doors for cleaning purposes.

Object name: MODEL OF MECHANICAL STOKER. (Scale 1:12.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by James Proctor, Esq., 1888.
Date of creation: 1888
Object entry information: In this sprinkler stoker, which was originally patented by Mr. Proctor in 1875, and has since been considerably simplified and improved, the feeding is performed by a flap, which jerks the fuel on to the grate in a way resembling hand-firing with a shovel, the further distribution of the charge being accomplished by the use of reciprocating fire bars.
The model shows the stoker fitted to the front of a Lancashire boiler, and feeding from a single coal hopper above, from which the fuel is distributed by a block, reciprocated horizontally along a pipe, to a small chamber at the front of each furnace. In each of these chambers is a flap which is moved away from the furnace by pegs on a revolving crank plate and then rapidly swung forward by the action of a spring, thus throwing and distributing the fuel on to the grate in small quantities. The fire bars are arranged in pairs alternately fixed and moving, the latter receiving a slow combined vertical and horizontal movement from a crank pin on a shaft driven by worm gearing. The whole of the motions are derived from a countershaft driven from an engine or by other means. Beneath each automatic feed hopper is a hinged flap for regulating the admission of air, and for use as a fire-door should hand-firing be resorted to.

Object entry information: The fuel is reduced to dust in the turbo-pulveriser situated on the boiler firing floor and this is blown with air in a burner into a combustion chamber in front of the boiler and below the floor level. The boiler is also fitted with a burner for coke oven gas and as the supply of this is variable, the powdered coal installation is capable of taking up anything up to full load. The motor is of 50 h.p. and can supply 30,000 lb. of coal per hour. The plant is for the supply of 20,000 lb. of steam per hour.

Object name: LIQUID FUEL BURNER. Plate 1X., No. 1.
Maker/Donor: Presented by J. J. Kermode, Esq., 1909.
Date of creation: 1909
Object entry information: This is a liquid fuel burner, patented by Mr. Kermode in 1894 and 1898, in which the oil is partially vaporised and sprayed by means of hot air, instead of by steam as in the Holden and other burners. The loss of water in the form of steam is to be avoided in marine work, besides hot air is also claimed to be more efficient than steam. The air is supplied by a compressor, at a pressure varying from 0.5 to 4 lb. per sq. in., according to circumstances, and it is passed through a heater, placed in the furnace or flue, before being led to the burner. The oil is fed either from a closed pressure tank or from an open tank placed at a height or from a closed pressure tank. The burner consists of a cylindrical outer casing, made in two parts, and containing two central concentric tubes or sleeves which direct the flow of the oil and air, and also serve as valves. Near the rear end of the casing is a branch E 4

Object entry information: The stoker is represented as fitted to the front of a Cornish boiler, the furnace flue of which has been cut out to show the arrangement of the grate. The fuel is stored in a large hopper above the stoker, from which it is fed by two inclined rectangular plungers, slowly reciprocated by two eccentrics on a countershaft driven by a ratchet feed from some source of power; the pawl of the ratchet acts on a projecting pin on an adjustable masking wheel, by which the attendant can regulate the supply of fuel to suit the steam demand. These two plungers work alternately and slowly push fuel on to as hort perforated dead plates, from which it falls on to the furnace, alternate bars of which are connected with two crossheads reciprocated horizontally by cams on the countershaft. The motion given to the bars is such that, although both sets move backward together, they move forward at different times; in this way the spaces between the bars are freed from clinker, and the mass of fuel is slowly worked towards the further end of the furnace, where the clinker and cinders accumulate and form a bank which acts as a fire-bridge, the excess being removed at intervals by raking it from the ash pit.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. John I. Thornycroft & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The particular feature of this burner, which is of the spray type, intended for boiler firing with light oil, is that it is designed to have varying outputs at constant pressure, thus increasing its range. This is achieved by having a sleeve to cut off one by one the supply grooves to the spraying or whirling chamber and by reducing the capacity of the latter at the same time.
As shown by the drawing, the sleeve A, with three tangential grooves in it, is rotated gradually in a recessed chamber B filled with oil under pressure, by a spindle actuated by a spring handle between stops. The grooves are thus blanked off successively, one by one. At the same time the screwed part advances the spindle axially upon a key in the sleeve and thus diminishes the volume of the chamber C. The following four positions are shown :—
0. Tangential grooves and exit hole closed.
1. One tangential groove open and whirling chamber slightly increased.
2. Two tangential grooves open and whirling chamber further increased.
3. Three tangential grooves open and whirling chamber maximum size.

Object name: OIL-FUEL SPRAYERS.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. John I. Thornycroft & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The particular feature of this burner, which is of the spray type, intended for boiler firing with light oil, is that it is designed to have varying outputs at constant pressure, thus increasing its range. This is achieved by having a sleeve to cut off one by one the supply grooves to the spraying or whirling chamber and by reducing the capacity of the latter at the same time.
As shown by the drawing, the sleeve A, with three tangential grooves in it, is rotated gradually in a recessed chamber B filled with oil under pressure, by a spindle actuated by a spring handle between stops. The grooves are thus blanked off successively, one by one. At the same time the screwed part advances the spindle axially upon a key in the sleeve and thus diminishes the volume of the chamber C. The following four positions are shown :—
0. Tangential grooves and exit hole closed.
1. One tangential groove open and whirling chamber slightly increased.
2. Two tangential grooves open and whirling chamber further increased.
3. Three tangential grooves open and whirling chamber maximum size.
Water tests have shown the following results :—

The latter burner, with Shell Mex. oil at 155 lb. pressure and 180° F., had an output of 2,130 lb. per hour.
An oil-fuel sprayer on the same principle with two grooves and with a graduated disc adjustment is also shown.

The plug is of the usual form, except that it has less taper, and that the key is fitted to the smaller end. The body of the cock is formed with four longitudinal recesses and a circular recess at each end, all of which are packed with asbestos. Above and below the plug are screwed covers, which act as glands for tightening up the packing as required. Three specimens are shown, one of which has a solid bottom and only one gland.

Object name: MODEL OF CENTRE-PRESSURE STOP VALVE. (Scale about 1:4.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. J. Hopkinson & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1907.
Object entry information: This valve, patented in 1903 by Mr. J. Hopkinson and improved in 1906, was designed to lessen the strains both on the valve and seat, whilst ensuring steam tightness. The example is of the screw-down type, with double mushroom valves, working in opposite directions, and closing on oppositely arranged seats in the same partition. The upper or main valve spindle is attached to a bridge piece engaging with a hollow screw-threaded sleeve of quick pitch. The upper part of this sleeve has a thread of half the pitch, engaging with a second bridge which is supported by pillars from the valve cover and which is capable of a limited movement between collars. The hand-wheel is fastened to the sleeve, and the spindle of the lower or controlling valve passes up through the sleeve and hand-wheel, the lower end of the sleeve bearing on a collar on the valve spindle. On turning the hand-wheel, the valve being shut, the upper bridge first rises until it reaches the stops; the lower bridge and the valve attached to it also rise, at double the rate during this period, owing to the pitch of the thread in the latter being double that in the former. On continuing the rotation of the hand-wheel, the sleeve screws through the upper bridge and descends, carrying with it the lower valve spindle and opening the controlling valve; the main valve is rising at the same rate, as a result of the differential motion of the lower bridge and the sleeve. A spring is provided to assist in returning the controlling valve to its seat. With this type of valve it is claimed that scoring action on the faces of both valve and seat, when opening or closing, is avoided. The controlling valve also prevents the flow of steam while the main valve is being opened or closed.

Object entry information: In this arrangement of stop valve, which was patented in 1904 by Mr. S. Z. de Ferranti, the size of the valve and the perimeter of leakage are reduced by the use of a valve of considerably less area than that of the piping, the requisite flow being obtained without excessive frictional losses by leading the fluid into the valve body by a gradually contracting vein, and then after it has passed the valve the excessive velocity energy is reconverted into pressure energy by the use of a corresponding but longer expanding orifice. The valve is of the sluice type, in two parts, one of which provides a free passage for the fluid, whilst the other contains two discs between which is a spring pressing them to the working faces to ensure steam tightness.

Object entry information: the valve body. Directly the valve lifts to the slightest extent the steam acts on an area increased by the annulus, consequently the compression on the spring is increased thereby obtaining ample discharge and a positive closing with a small amount of pressure drop. The use of flat seats also gives maximum opening for a given lift. The valve and seats are of gunmetal and the gunmetal spindle is guided vertically by fitting it within a cylindrical cast-iron housing that encloses the helical spring. The valve spindle is furnished with an adjustable sleeve and a lock. The easing lever—for use to see that the valve does not stick— and spring are of steel. The outlet is 3 in. diam., and the valve is designed for a working pressure of 200 lb. per sq. in.

Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. J. Hopkinson & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1907.
Object entry information: This valve, patented in 1903 by Mr. J. Hopkinson and improved in 1906, was designed to lessen the strains both on the valve and seat, whilst ensuring steam tightness. The example is of the screw-down type, with double mushroom valves, working in opposite directions, and closing on oppositely arranged seats in the same partition. The upper or main valve spindle is attached to a bridge piece engaging with a hollow screw-threaded sleeve of quick pitch. The upper part of this sleeve has a thread of half the pitch, engaging with a second bridge which is supported by pillars from the valve cover and which is capable of a limited movement between collars. The hand-wheel is fastened to the sleeve, and the spindle of the lower or controlling valve passes up through the sleeve and hand-wheel, the lower end of the sleeve bearing on a collar on the valve spindle. On turning the hand-wheel, the valve being shut, the upper bridge first rises until it reaches the stops; the lower bridge and the valve attached to it also rise, at double the rate during this period, owing to the pitch of the thread in the latter being double that in the former. On continuing the rotation of the hand-wheel, the sleeve screws through the upper bridge and descends, carrying with it the lower valve spindle and opening the controlling valve; the main valve is rising at the same rate, as a result of the differential motion of the lower bridge and the sleeve. A spring is provided to assist in returning the controlling valve to its seat. With this type of valve it is claimed that scoring action on the faces of both valve and seat, when opening or closing, is avoided. The controlling valve also prevents the flow of steam while the main valve is being opened or closed.

Object name: ACCESSIBLE SEAT VALVE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. S. Dixon and Son, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1920.
Object entry information: The special feature of this steam valve is that the seat is carried above the valve body, so that when the cover is removed the seat can be inspected, and if necessary refaced or ground without special tools, as patented in 1904 by Mr. H. Rennie. This is accomplished by making the seat in the form of a tube, leaving an annular space round it equal in area to the bore. The valve is of the ordinary three-winged type, but in another design ; the valve is solid with the spindle, so that when fully open it makes a joint on the underside of the stuffing box which can then if necessary be packed under pressure. The valve shown is 0.375 in. diam., throughway, with screwed ends.

Object entry information: This is a valve, patented by Messrs. J. & J. Greenhalgh in 1862, for maintaining a uniform pressure in a steam pipe, less than that of the source from which the steam is taken. There are two pistons on a vertical spindle, working in cylinders, and the steam is admitted to the space between them ; the lower piston acts as a valve, and has portions cut away from its upper part, so that the steam can pass around the lower edge of its cylinder. A spring bears down on the spindle and can be adjusted by a set screw which is locked in position. If the pressure of the steam increases, the valve will rise and reduce the area of the passage through which it flows. A sectional drawing elucidating the construction is shown.

Object entry information: The arrangement of this appliance, for automatically reducing the pressure of steam or other fluid to some lower but constant pressure, was patented in 1896 by Mr. J. M. Foster. The valve itself is of the double-beat equilibrium type, but, to overcome the difficulties arising from the variation in temperature of the stem connecting the two discs, the face of the upper one is nearly flat, while the lower one has a very acute chamfer. Above the valve box, but cast with it, is a circular dish separated by a flexible metallic diaphragm from a similar dish above it which is open to the atmosphere, while the spindle of the valve extends upward and is attached to a cap in the centre of this diaphragm. Above the top dish are two horizontal tie-rods, connected by crossheads, which control two helical springs under compression, and these, by short vertical levers, press upon a pair of toggle plates, which thereby exert a downward thrust upon the diaphragm and valve spindle. The boiler steam enters the space between the two valves, and rushes to the reduced pressure pipe beyond; some, however, passes through a vertical communicating orifice to the under side of the diaphragm, which is thereby thrust upward and carrying the valve with it reduces the supply of steam, and consequently lowers the pressure below the diaphragm. In this way the valve finds and maintains a position in which the pressure of the reduced steam on the diaphragm balances the effort exerted by the external helical springs. By the introduction of the toggle plates the rise in the reduced pressure, which would result from the increased compression of the springs when the valve is fully opened, is prevented by the alteration that at the same time takes place in the angle of the toggle joint.

The boiler steam enters the space between the two valves, and rushes to the reduced pressure pipe beyond; some, however, passes through a vertical communicating orifice to the under side of the diaphragm, which is thereby thrust upward and carrying the valve with it reduces the supply of steam, and consequently lowers the pressure below the diaphragm. In this way the valve finds and maintains a position in which the pressure of the reduced steam on the diaphragm balances the effort exerted by the external helical springs. By the introduction of the toggle plates the rise in the reduced pressure, which would result from the increased compression of the springs when the valve is fully opened, is prevented by the alteration that at the same time takes place in the angle of the toggle joint.

Object entry information: The main valve is a single mushroom valve, with a flat face, held on its seat by a helical spring, and lifted by a differential piston placed below it. The upper side of the piston is in communication with the reduced steam, while the lower side is open to the high-pressure steam through a passage which is controlled by the regulator valve. The regulator is placed above the main valve, and its stem is held by a spring in contact with the diaphragm, upon the under side of which the reduced pressure acts. The upper side of the diaphragm is acted upon by a helical spring, the pressure of which can be adjusted to give the desired reduction. When steam is admitted, it passes through the regulator to the lower piston, which raises the valve high enough to give the required pressure at the outlet. Any variation in the pressure, on either side of the valve, disturbs the balance of the parts and causes the valve to open or close, so as to keep the outlet pressure constant. The valve is intended for maintaining a reduced pressure of from 5 lb. to 50 lb. with initial pressures up to 300 lb. per sq. in., but the initial pressure must be from 10 to 15 lb. higher than the reduced pressure.

Object entry information: The arrangement of this appliance, for automatically reducing the pressure of steam or other fluid to some lower but constant pressure, was patented in 1896 by Mr. J. M. Foster. The valve itself is of the double-beat equilibrium type, but, to overcome the difficulties arising from the variation in temperature of the stem connecting the two discs, the face of the upper one is nearly flat, while the lower one has a very acute chamfer. Above the valve box, but cast with it, is a circular dish separated by a flexible metallic diaphragm from a similar dish above it which is open to the atmosphere, while the spindle of the valve extends upward and is attached to a cap in the centre of this diaphragm. Above the top dish are two horizontal tie-rods, connected by crossheads, which control two helical springs under compression, and these, by short vertical levers, press upon a pair of toggle plates, which thereby exert a downward thrust upon the diaphragm and valve spindle.

Object entry information: The chief feature of this boiler gauge, which takes the place of the ordinary gauge glass, is that it has a device to render the water level easily visible. The gauge is a brass frame with a glazed front while at the back is a glass ground with five vertical flutes forming prisms, as patented in 1890 by Mr. R. Klinger. The property of this is that light passing through the space filled with steam is reflected and appears silvery white, while that passing through the water is absorbed and appears black. The gauge is made in a number of sizes and for different pressures; that shown is size 7 for pressures up to 150 lb.

Object entry information: This is a boiler gauge glass protector combined with a water level reflector of registered design known as the ""Simplex."" The protector consists of three strips of plate glass 0.4 in. thick, held in grooves in two brass plates to form a box which can be readily slipped on to the gauge glass. The upper plate has a hole to fit round the stuffing-box nut, while the lower plate is recessed to rest on the corresponding nut below. The reflector is a slightly convex plate on which are enamelled alternate white and black bars inclined at an angle of about 20° to the horizontal; this slips into grooves behind the gauge glass. Seen through the steam space the bars appear to be distorted helically, while seen through the water space the bars appear to reverse hand; thus the water level is quite apparent even in dark surroundings. The protector meets the requirements of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, one clause of which requires the provision of protection for the gauge glass of boilers to guard against accident in case of breakage of the gauge glass. The protector is made in lengths from 8 in. to 20 in. in the clear; the size shown is 11 in.

Object entry information: This attachment for a boiler water gauge is used to overcome the difficulty frequently experienced in a bad light of reading the level of the water, and is a modification of the familiar gauge glass with the red stripe painted on the back, the object being to use the glass, where it is filled with water, as a lens. It consists of an ordinary incandescent electric lamp mounted on a double-jointed arm furnished with a wing nut, and secured to an adaptable bracket. The lamp has a metal cover with a slot in the side and a hole in the top. A flat strip of metal or screen, painted red, is clipped on to the gauge glass, and the lamp and screen are so adjusted that the light is focussed by the glass over the length filled by water, but does not appreciably illuminate the screen above that level. The height of the water is clearly represented by a bright strip of light on the screen. The fitting can be applied to existing boiler gauges as shown.

Object entry information: Automatic valves are provided to prevent the escape of steam and water in case of a tube breaking. The one at the lower end is a simple ball valve which normally leaves a clear passage, but which would be forced up against its seat by a sudden rush of water. The ball can be easily removed through the front plug hole. The upper valve consists of a conical valve, held on its seat by the steam pressure; and having a passage through it leading to an orifice in the side of a cylindrical stem. A bent spring has one end opposite the orifice and is of sufficient strength to resist ordinary blowing through, but if the glass tube breaks the steam pressure would overcome the spring and force it over so as to close the orifice. The valve is lifted out through the top plug hole when cleaning out the upper passage. A protecting screen of plate glass 0.5 in. thick is placed round the tube in order to minimise the danger resulting from a burst.

Object entry information: This is a boiler gauge glass protector combined with a water level reflector of registered design known as the ""Simplex."" The protector consists of three strips of plate glass 0.4 in. thick, held in grooves in two brass plates to form a box which can be readily slipped on to the gauge glass. The upper plate has a hole to fit round the stuffing-box nut, while the lower plate is recessed to rest on the corresponding nut below. The reflector is a slightly convex plate on which are enamelled alternate white and black bars inclined at an angle of about 20° to the horizontal; this slips into grooves behind the gauge glass. Seen through the steam space the bars appear to be distorted helically, while seen through the water space the bars appear to reverse hand; thus the water level is quite apparent even in dark surroundings. The protector meets the requirements of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, one clause of which requires the provision of protection for the gauge glass of boilers to guard against accident in case of breakage of the gauge glass. The protector is made in lengths from 8 in. to 20 in. in the clear; the size shown is 11 in.

Reid's brewery, Clerkenwell, where the boiler pressure was 5 lb. above atmosphere. This gauge represents the arrangement in general use till about 1850, when the continual increase in pressure led to the adoption of dial gauges. The apparatus consists of an inverted siphon pipe of wrought iron, one extremity of which was provided with a flange for attachment to the cylinder jacket or to the steam pipe, while the other was fitted with a socket which supported a glass tube that protected a light rod terminating in a cork disc. The siphon was half filled with mercury, so that when the steam pressure increased it caused the mercury to rise in the outer leg and so lift the rod within the glass tube, thus indicating the pressure, usually upon a scale placed behind the tube. The tube was closed at the top, but was so fitted as not to seal the end of the siphon.

Object entry information: This is a gauge in which the pressure is measured by the deflection of a flat diaphragm, the deflection being magnified, and the pressure indicated by a column of fluid in a glass tube leading from the diaphragm chamber. It was patented by Mr. J. Webster in 1853. The instrument consists of a cast-iron chamber 3 in. diam., made in two parts, bolted together with a thin steel plate between them. Steam or other fluid is admitted to the lower part of the chamber, below the diaphragm, while the upper part communicates with a glass tube 0.2 in. diam. mounted in a brass casing, on the face of which the pressure scale is engraved. The fluid contained in the upper chamber is partly expelled when the other suitable fluid, contained in the upper chamber is partly expelled when the pressure deflects the diaphragm and rises in the tube, the motion being magnified in the ratio of the diameter of the chamber and tube. The instrument must be calibrated from a standard gauge, when using the same fluid as that for which it is to be used, as allowance has to be made for the expansion of the measuring fluid when using the gauge for steam pressures. The scale covers a range from o to 200 lb. per sq. in., and the space between the scale divisions diminishes as the pressure increases.

The fluid contained in the upper chamber is partly expelled when the other suitable fluid, contained in the upper chamber is partly expelled when the pressure deflects the diaphragm and rises in the tube, the motion being magnified in the ratio of the diameter of the chamber and tube. The instrument must be calibrated from a standard gauge, when using the same fluid as that for which it is to be used, as allowance has to be made for the expansion of the measuring fluid when using the gauge for steam pressures. The scale covers a range from o to 200 lb. per sq. in., and the space between the scale divisions diminishes as the pressure increases.

Reid's brewery, Clerkenwell, where the boiler pressure was 5 lb. above atmosphere. This gauge represents the arrangement in general use till about 1850, when the continual increase in pressure led to the adoption of dial gauges. The apparatus consists of an inverted siphon pipe of wrought iron, one extremity of which was provided with a flange for attachment to the cylinder jacket or to the steam pipe, while the other was fitted with a socket which supported a glass tube that protected a light rod terminating in a cork disc. The siphon was half filled with mercury, so that when the steam pressure increased it caused the mercury to rise in the outer leg and so lift the rod within the glass tube, thus indicating the pressure, usually upon a scale placed behind the tube. The tube was closed at the top, but was so fitted as not to seal the end of the siphon.

Object entry information: As boiler pressures increased, the mercury gauge originally used became very inconvenient, owing to the height of the column required; hence locomotive drivers were unprovided with any means of telling the steam pressure; in a few instances a form of thermometric gauge was adopted, but the usual practice was to rely upon the indications derived from the spring-loaded safety valve. Mr. Sydney Smith, of Nottingham, was one of the earliest to produce a convenient form of mechanical pressure gauge, and this he patented in 1847, while in the same year he submitted it to George Stephenson, who at once had it tried on one of the boilers at his Tapton colliery. The gauge consisted of a diaphragm of vulcanised india-rubber held at its circumference between flanges which connected the two halves of a spherical chamber. The lower half of the chamber was in communication with the boiler, and the upper half supported a rod, so connecting it with the centre of the diaphragm that it indicated in a greatly magnified manner the amount of bulging which the pressure was occasioning. In 1854 Mr. Smith patented an improved form of this gauge, and the example shown, which was made about 1860 and was in use for 40 years, is of this later type. The diaphragm is still of vulcanised rubber, but it is loaded or reinforced by a close volute spring wound with such a camber that at the working pressure it is approximately flat. To the centre of the spring is secured a vertically guided rack gearing into a pinion on the index spindle, as shown in the attached sectional drawing.

Object entry information: The form of pressure gauge shown was introduced in 1849 by Mons. E. Bourdon, who discovered the action upon which it relies while attempting to remove, by the application of internal pressure, the flattening caused in a pipe by bending it into a coil. When a fluid pressure was applied the pipe slightly straightened, and by fitting the free end with a pointer, found that reliable readings of the pressure were thus obtainable. This action depends on the fact that the product of the curvatures of a surface in planes at right angles is constant, so that if one radius of curvature is diminished, as by the elliptical section becoming more nearly circular, the other radius increases. The gauge consists of a thin curved tube of elliptical section, with one end fixed in a block to which the admission pipe is attached, while the other end is free; this end is closed and connected by multiplying gear with the index. In one of the forms shown, a link from the end of the tube is connected with a short extension of the index finger, which is pivoted near the edge of the dial.

Object entry information: This is a modern gauge of the diaphragm type. The diaphragm is of thin steel held between flanges and is corrugated to increase its sensitiveness. The upward movement of the diaphragm due to the steam pressure is transmitted to the index spindle by means of a connecting link attached to a toothed segment gearing with the central pinion, an extension of which carries the pointer on the dial. A copper hair-spring, attached to the pinion at one end and to the frame at the other, serves to take up backlash between the teeth of the quadrant and pinion.

Object entry information: This is a modern gauge of the diaphragm type. The diaphragm is of thin steel held between flanges and is corrugated to increase its sensitiveness. The upward movement of the diaphragm due to the steam pressure is transmitted to the index spindle by means of a connecting link attached to a toothed segment gearing with the central pinion, an extension of which carries the pointer on the dial. A copper hair-spring, attached to the pinion at one end and to the frame at the other, serves to take up backlash between the teeth of the quadrant and pinion. The gauge is graduated for pressures up to 200 lb. per sq. in.

Object entry information: This is a compound gauge on the Bourdon principle (see No. 414) for indicating both pressure and vacuum. When steam under pressure is admitted to the Bourdon tube it tends to uncoil, the free end moving outwards or away from the boss; if, however, the pressure of the steam is below the atmosphere, the free end of the tube moves inwards. The tube is connected to the pointer by the usual toothed quadrant and pinion. A hard copper hair-spring is provided to eliminate backlash. The gauge is graduated from atmospheric pressure in lb. per sq. in., and below atmosphere in inches of mercury to 30 in. vacuum.

Object entry information: This instrument was designed and made by Mr. A. Rigg in 1859. Its object was to record the pressure, once in every thousand revolutions, of a beam engine driving millstones for grinding white lead. The instrument is connected with the engine by the shaft projecting from the front of the box, which drove a ratchet inside, operating three discs acting as cams. The cams revolved at different speeds, and when the notches cut in them coincided, a small lever, held in contact with the cams by a spring, fell into the depression and opened a valve, putting the indicator (the McNaught indicator (see No. 321)), into communication with the engine cylinder; the steam pipe for this connection is shown at the back of the box. The variations in pressure were thus admitted, then recorded, on an endless paper band, the variations in pressure for one complete revolution of the engine. The travel of the paper band round the drum was about 0.25 in. for every thousand revolutions of the engine, and as the engine made 18 rev. per min., the intervals of recording pressure were about 55 min. A portion of a record taken with this instrument in 1859-60 is shown. The recorder was also used for testing the continuity of a water supply by taking the pressure at every thousand revolutions of a water wheel temporarily arranged to drive it.

Date of creation: 1874
Object entry information: The feature of this gauge, patented by Mr. G. A. Everett in 1873, is that, in addition to the ordinary indication of the actual pressure, it is made to indicate the number of times a given pressure has been exceeded in the working of the apparatus to which the gauge is fixed, and also the extent to which such pressure has been exceeded. The latter object is effected by a short index or pointer, which turns about the same axis as the ordinary index, and is pushed forward by it as the pressure rises, and remains as a record of the maximum attained. The number of times that a given pressure has been exceeded is recorded by three small pointers working on one axis, driven by a system of ratchet wheels.

Date of creation: 1914
Object entry information: This is a sectioned example of the device, patented by Mr. A. R. Trist in 1911, for regulating automatically the quantity of feed-water delivered to a boiler so as to maintain a constant water level. Waste of fuel, due to incorrect or large variations in level which occur with hand-feed regulation, are thus avoided. The apparatus consists of two parts, a float chamber and a regulator. The float chamber is a cast-iron vessel connected near the top with the steam space of the boiler, well above the water level, and at the bottom with the water space well below the water level. Within this vessel is an electrolytically sealed copper float connected by toggle levers with a vertical spindle, carrying at its upper end a two-faced controlling valve which rests on either of two seatings formed on the opposite faces of a gunmetal block. The valve seat and toggle levers are attached to a long sleeve passing through the cover of the float chamber, the sleeve being screwed for part of its length which passes through a nut, by which its height can be adjusted so as to set the water level at any desired point. Steam is led from the underside of the controlling valve seating block through radial holes with a pipe leading to the regulator. The upper part of the regulator is open to the atmosphere. The regulator consists of a gunmetal feed valve with a piston working in a cylinder above it. The upper part of the cylinder is connected with the pipe from the controlling valve, while its lower end is open to the atmosphere. The feed valve is normally held open by a spring, acting through a lever, and is pressed down to close it when steam is admitted to the cylinder.

Object entry information: The trouble brought about by the presence of grease in boiler feed water is well known, but the loss of efficiency in feed heaters, etc., owing to the deposition of oil carried forward by exhaust steam has not been so widely recognised. The mechanical separator shown is for the purpose of removing such oil. It was patented in 1902 onwards by Mr. W. J. Baker, who had been working on the subject earlier. The separator is most conveniently made, as shown, cylindrical in form, with the inlet and outlet branches arranged to suit its position. The exhaust steam carrying oil and water in suspension enters an expansion compartment, where reduction of velocity and temperature takes place, allowing the water and oil to coalesce into drops that impinge on the sides and on the surface of water, filling the lower part of the vessel 3 to 6 in. in depth. The steam passes under a deflector or baffle into the second compartment, where it impinges on vertical angles of special section staggered in rows. The oil and water so arrested trickle down these collectors by gravity and float off at the grease off-take, which is provided on the shell behind these collectors. It is claimed that the apparatus is thus self-cleansing. A drain on the bottom cover is provided for periodical blow-off purposes. A set of water-gauges is fitted to indicate the water-level. The apparatus is applicable also for other purposes, such as the extraction of tar from fuel gas. The apparatus is made in a very large number of sizes, from 1.5 in. diam. exhaust (160 lb. of steam per hour) to 40 in. diam. (150,000 lb. per hour).

When the water level falls, the controlling valve is raised on to its lower seat, steam is cut off from the regulator and its cylinder is exhausted to the atmosphere, so that the spring comes into action and re-opens the feed valve. The steam connection between the controlling valve and the regulator is fitted with a double-seated valve, which in one position permits steam to pass to the regulator, but in the other position shuts off the steam and permanently puts the regulator to atmosphere, so that the latter may be put out of action if desired. In case of puncture of the float or breakage of the mechanism, the feed valve will remain wide open, so that there will be no risk of shortness of water. It is claimed that the water level can be maintained within 0.125 in. of correct level with ordinary boilers, or within 0.25 in. with water-tube boilers. The example shown is for a 2 in. diam. feed pipe.

Object name: FEED WATER FILTER.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. Maudslay, Sons & Field.
Date of creation: Received 1909.
Object entry information: This is a filter for removing grease from condenser water before feeding it back into the boiler. It has a cylindrical chamber with a removable top cover and water connections at the top and bottom. Within this is a "" cartridge "" consisting of a number of horizontal circular grids, between which are placed sheets of wire gauze and turkish towelling or flannel. The cartridge is held down on a flange by set screws passing through stuffing-boxes in the cover, and the water, entering at the bottom, passes up through the grids and leaves any grease in the towelling. The filter is arranged with a by-pass in the piping, so that it may be cut out for the purpose of substituting a clean cartridge for the dirty one. The filter is designed for a pressure of about 150 lb. per sq. in.

Object name: MODEL OF OIL SEPARATOR. (Scale about 1:4.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Bakers (Leeds), Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The trouble brought about by the presence of grease in boiler feed water is well known, but the loss of efficiency in feed heaters, etc., owing to the deposition of oil carried forward by exhaust steam has not been so widely recognised. The mechanical separator shown is for the purpose of removing such oil. It was patented in 1902 onwards by Mr. W. J. Baker, who had been working on the subject earlier. The separator is most conveniently made, as shown, cylindrical in form, with the inlet and outlet branches arranged to suit its position. The exhaust steam carrying oil and water in suspension enters an expansion compartment, where reduction of velocity and temperature takes place, allowing the water and oil to coalesce into drops that impinge on the sides and on the surface of water, filling the lower part of the vessel 3 to 6 in. in depth. The steam passes under a deflector or baffle into the second compartment, where it impinges on vertical angles of special section staggered in rows. The oil and water so arrested trickle down these collectors by gravity and float off at the grease off-take, which is provided on the shell behind these collectors. It is claimed that the apparatus is thus self-cleansing. A drain on the bottom cover is provided for periodical blow-off purposes. A set of water-gauges is fitted to indicate the water-level. The apparatus is applicable also for other purposes, such as the extraction of tar from fuel gas. The apparatus is made in a very large number of sizes, from 1.5 in. diam. exhaust (160 lb. of steam per hour) to 40 in. diam. (150,000 lb. per hour).

Object entry information: This is a thermometer for taking the temperature of boiler flue gases, superheaters, etc. Its action depends on the expansion of mercury in a closed vessel. A steel cylinder, formed in the end of a tube by which it can be inserted in the boiler flue, etc., is connected through two flexible steel tubes with two Bourdon type tubes. The tubes are shaped like volute springs and their free ends are connected by linkage to a toothed quadrant; the increase of pressure due to the expansion of the mercury under heat is thus transmitted to the pointer indicating on the dial. Instruments with single tubing are liable to error when the latter exceeds 15 ft. in length, due to variations in the temperature of the tubing itself, and to obviate this double coils are used. The movement or expansion of the coils resulting from pressure variations in the flexible tubes is compensated in the mechanism. The flexible tubing may be any length up to 150 ft., so that the indicator dial may be placed in a position convenient for observation, yet well away from the source of heat. Temperatures from 100° F. to 950° F. can be recorded.

Hinman, for measuring the percentage of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in flue gases, and is thus of use for checking and improving plant efficiency. In principle it makes use of the reaction between carbon dioxide and caustic soda. A hand-operated plunger working in a pump barrel draws a sample of the gas mixture from the flue through a three-way cock and rubber connection. This gas is allowed to fall to the temperature of the room, which may be read on a thermometer enclosed in the pump rod. The lower end of the pump rod is graduated with a scale marked in degrees of temperature, and by drawing the plunger out to the graduation corresponding to the room temperature, the correct amount of gas is used. A small cylindrical cartridge, containing a definite quantity of pulverised caustic soda, is packed at both ends and inserted in a receptacle in the instrument, where it is surrounded by the bell-shaped bulb of a thermometer which fits closely round it. This thermometer reads against an adjustable scale graduated in percentages of carbon dioxide, the scale being set to zero before the instrument is used. Having taken the sample of gas, the rubber tube is connected to a hard rubber plug beneath the cartridge and the plunger depressed. The gas is driven through the cartridge and the rise in temperature reads directly as a percentage of carbon dioxide.

The channel is open at the top to the lower side of the tube plate. Screwed into the tube plate are a number of vertical tubes, open to the exhaust steam at the bottom, but closed at their upper ends, which are left perfectly free to expand or contract without straining. In each of these heating tubes is a small circulating tube leading from near their upper ends to the channel through which the exhaust steam passes, and the mouths are so arranged that the passing steam causes an induced current out of them, and thus out of the upper ends of the heating tubes, removing the air which they contain, or which may be carried in with the exhaust steam, and causing them to be filled with steam. A small portion of the heating tubes projects into the exhaust steam, and assists in diverting the steam into them.

Object entry information: In this feed-water heater, patented by Mr. J. Atkinson in 1877, the exhaust steam from the engine enters at the steam inlet and passes in a direct unimpeded course through a channel provided for it, which is of a similar sectional area throughout, to the steam outlet, from which the exhaust pipe conducts away the steam not utilised in heating the water.
The channel is open at the top to the lower side of the tube plate. Screwed into the tube plate are a number of vertical tubes, open to the exhaust steam at the bottom, but closed at their upper ends, which are left perfectly free to expand or contract without straining. In each of these heating tubes is a small circulating tube leading from near their upper ends to the channel through which the exhaust steam passes, and the mouths are so arranged that the passing steam causes an induced current out of them, and thus out of the upper ends of the heating tubes, removing the air which they contain, or which may be carried in with the exhaust steam, and causing them to be filled with steam. A small portion of the heating tubes projects into the exhaust steam, and assists in diverting the steam into them.

A subsidiary advantage is that more duty can be obtained from the boiler with it than without it, and troubles from expansion and contraction are minimised. The apparatus is built into the main flue between the boiler and the chimney. In the particular case shown in the model the boiler is of the Lancashire type and the apparatus is arranged in a by-pass flue with suitable valves, so that the boiler may be worked with or without it. The economiser shown embodies improvements patented by Mr. A. Lowcock and Mr. T. Sykes between 1880 and 1894.

Row in 1891, and in the form represented it would be used in connection with a boiler or ""evaporator,"" for obtaining fresh water from sea water; with slight modifications, however, the arrangement can be converted into a feed-water heater. The condenser consists of an outer casing containing a number of vertical tubes, the ends of which are either expanded into a tube plate or made tight by some form of screw joint; the cooling water circulates within the casing, its inlet and outlet being at the side, while the steam or vapour to be condensed passes through the tubes, entering at the top and being discharged as condensed feed or drinking water at the bottom. If the water is required for drinking purposes it is aerated by the pipe shown, the air entering through the hooded orifice and passing into the condenser, where it mixes with, and is partially absorbed by, the distilled water. The chief feature of this condenser is the form of tube employed, of which a short portion of an actual length is shown. This ""Row"" tube is indented at intervals along its length, so as to reduce the section at each indentation to a narrow rectangle at right angles to the adjacent ones; in this way the free passage along the tube of the vapour and water, both inside and outside, is checked, and the formation of steady streams avoided, thus increasing the transference of heat by the greater amount of impact contact secured.

It is constructed of vertical cast-iron pipes whose ends are forced by hydraulic pressure into top and bottom headers; the top headers are provided with a lid or cleaning cover, while the bottom ones have a slope towards the blow-off branch pipe, to which is attached a blow-off valve. Each tube is fitted with scrapers, which are moved slowly up and down to remove the soot which would otherwise accumulate and would seriously detract from the efficiency of the apparatus. The scrapers are worked in balanced groups by chains passing over pulleys actuated by worm gear, the reversals at the end of their travel being effected by a tappet-moved, three bevel wheel clutch, and assisted by a rolling weight. The soot scraped off falls into a chamber below the pipes and is removed at intervals through cleaning doors. The feed-water is forced into the economiser by the feed-pump or injector through the bottom branch pipe at the end furthest from the boiler and leaves by the top branch nearest the boiler, so that the hottest gas meets the hottest water. The economiser is made in sections of from 4 to 12 pipes in width and of any length to suit the number and capacity of the boilers installed. Each tube has over 10 sq. ft. of heating surface. The feed-water is usually supplied to the economiser at 32 deg. C. (90 deg. F.) and leaves at 120 deg. C. (250 deg. F.) to 150 deg. C. (300 deg. F.), a saving of fuel of as much as 20 per cent. is claimed. An indirect advantage of the use of an economiser is that most of the impurities of the feed-water are deposited in the apparatus, whence they can be blown out daily and thus avoid incrustation in the boiler.

Object name: FRESH WATER CONDENSER.
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Royles, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1902.
Object entry information: This condenser embodies improvements patented by Mr. O. M. Row in 1891, and in the form represented it would be used in connection with a boiler or ""evaporator,"" for obtaining fresh water from sea water; with slight modifications, however, the arrangement can be converted into a feed-water heater. The condenser consists of an outer casing containing a number of vertical tubes, the ends of which are either expanded into a tube plate or made tight by some form of screw joint; the cooling water circulates within the casing, its inlet and outlet being at the side, while the steam or vapour to be condensed passes through the tubes, entering at the top and being discharged as condensed feed or drinking water at the bottom. If the water is required for drinking purposes it is aerated by the pipe shown, the air entering through the hooded orifice and passing into the condenser, where it mixes with, and is partially absorbed by, the distilled water. The chief feature of this condenser is the form of tube employed, of which a short portion of an actual length is shown. This ""Row"" tube is indented at intervals along its length, so as to reduce the section at each indentation to a narrow rectangle at right angles to the adjacent ones; in this way the free passage along the tube of the vapour and water, both inside and outside, is checked, and the formation of steady streams avoided, thus increasing the transference of heat by the greater amount of impact contact secured.

The steam cylinder is arranged vertically over the pump barrel, and the pump rod is attached to an inverted kite-shaped casting which terminates in the pump plunger; within the loop of this casting is arranged a connecting rod, attached to it and to the overhanging crank of a flywheel shaft, so that direct action is secured while the control of a crank and flywheel is retained. The slide valve is worked by an eccentric on the crankshaft, and the other end of this shaft is provided with another crank working a similar single-acting pump; the cranks are set opposite, so that the pumps deliver alternately. Sometimes double-acting pumps are substituted, while very frequently there are two steam cylinders in the arrangement shown. The pump valve bores are formed in the supporting columns which act as air vessels.]

The machine is arranged with the steam cylinder at one end, the large piston rod of which is carried through and forms the plunger of a single-acting pump at the opposite end of the machine. The flywheel and shaft with an overhanging crank are placed midway, the crankpin being connected with a pin on the pump ram by a connecting rod whose effective length is equal to the radius of the crank path.

The outer extremity of the short connecting rod is in this way controlled, and the kinematic chain closed during the time it would otherwise be incomplete. The result is that the throw of the crank is increased by the length of the connecting rod at each end of the stroke. The adjacent diagram shows the positions of crank and connecting rod at various portions of a revolution, the connecting rod being coloured blue, the ram red, and the stationary notches grey. The admission of steam is controlled by an ordinary eccentric and slide valve, but when required to drive by hand, a handle is inserted in the fly-wheel.

Object entry information: This feed pump valve, patented by Mr. J. G. Kinghorn in 1886, is designed for high pressures. Shock is much reduced by the independent action of each disc and by the cushioning effect of the film of water formed between them. It is claimed to be lighter than other types of valves for the same service. The valve consists of three superimposed discs, of decreasing diameters, made of a tough rust-resisting metal, which are free to move independently on a fixed central stud, the lowest disc resting normally on the flat seating. The two lower discs are perforated in such a way that the openings can never overlap. A heavy guard is fitted to limit the valve opening, and this contains a helical spring, which tends to keep the valve shut. When water is forced through the valve the discs lift and some of the water flows through the perforations and between the discs, forming films which act as cushions when the valve strikes the guard. A similar action occurs on closing. In this way shock and wear are reduced, giving the valve a long life. When dealing with a large quantity of water it is better to use several small valves of this type rather than a single large one.

Object entry information: there is a steam-moved main or distributing valve working horizontally and controlling the admission and exhaust of the steam to the cylinder ends, and an auxiliary valve, worked by a tappet gear, moving vertically on the back of the main valve and controlling its movements while also serving as a cut-off valve. The main valve is an ordinary slide valve, hollow, cylindrical at its middle, where ports are formed, and it slides on a cylindrical face which is provided with the usual cylinder ports. The cylindrical ends at fro fit into small cylinders or caps in the ends of the steam chest; the D-shaped part of the valve forms a flat face across which the auxiliary valve moves, and ports are formed in it leading to the ends of the main valve, and others admitting steam to the cylinder ports. The auxiliary valve is moved by a tappet lever driven from the middle point of the piston rod, and it admits steam alternately to the ends of the main valve thus causing it to move to and fro; the auxiliary valve also cuts off the steam at about 0.75 of the stroke, the remainder being performed by expansion. When starting or when otherwise necessary steam may be admitted during the whole stroke through by-passes cut in the main valve and its caps; these are opened by rotating the caps from outside the valve chest. As the main valve must be at one end or the other of its stroke, the pump is always ready to start. The water cylinder is double-acting; it has a gunmetal liner and the piston is packed with ebonite rings. The inlet and discharge valves are of the Kinghorn pattern (see No. 451), each having three discs with a spring and guard above; they are arranged one above the other and their seatings and guards are held in position by a single screw above.

It consists of two slightly different Giffard injectors (see No. 452), arranged in series, so that the first, or lifter, feeds the other, or forcer, which delivers into the boiler. The delivery chambers of both lifter and forcer communicate with the overflow pipe by a three-way starting cock; the latter and the two conical steam valves are manipulated by a single hand-lever. When starting, the lever is moved through a part only of its travel, thus slightly opening the steam valves and at the same time opening both delivery chambers to overflow; the arrangement then readily lifts water by its steam exhauster action. The handle is then moved right over, so as to open fully both steam valves and close completely the overflow, after which the forcing injector feeds into the boiler.""

It consists of two Giffard's injectors (see No. 452), arranged in series, so that the first acts as a lifter and the second as a forcer, an arrangement that facilitates starting. The forcer valve at the top admits steam to the second injector, and there are two overflow valves, the upper one when open allowing the water and condensed steam from the lifter to pass direct to the overflow. In a modification of the above by the same makers, all the valves are actuated by a single lever.""

Object entry information: ""This is a sectioned example of the injector patented by Messrs. Hamer, Metcalfe, and Davies, in 1877–80, in which, by an important modification in the usual construction, self-starting is secured and the apparatus is enabled to work with the exhaust steam from an engine, instead of requiring live steam from the boiler. The injector consists of a cast-iron casing containing the usual three nozzles, the steam nozzle, however, being exceptionally large on account of the large volume of steam to be passed, and having a conical spike in its centre to assist in concentrating the steam. The combining nozzle is the leading feature, however, as it is split or divided into two parts over a portion of its length by an axial plane, and one of these parts is hinged to the main portion at its upper end, so as to become a movable flap. The combining and delivery nozzles are connected together, and the water supply orifice beyond them is rendered adjustable by means of a nut at the delivery end. The overflow pipe has a chamber with a partition across it, which forms a water seal, and so prevents the entry of air into the combining cone. When starting, the steam and water escape freely into the overflow by the open flap, but when the combined jet acquires such a velocity as to be capable of feeding the boiler its exhaustive action becomes sufficient to close the flap, so that the water passes into the boiler through the delivery pipe. These injectors will, with exhaust steam, feed against a pressure of about 75 lb. per sq. in.; if required to supply a boiler at a higher pressure, an extra steam nozzle, supplied with boiler steam, is added to assist in the work; or else a supplementary injector supplied with boiler steam is used, which takes the water, already heated and raised to a considerable pressure by the exhaust injector, along into the boiler.""

The example shown is of this type, but embodies several improvements, and, although not compound, can work with comparatively hot feed water.
The control handle is fixed to a spindle, which is free to revolve but is incapable of longitudinal motion within the body of the injector. Near the lower end of the spindle is a quick-threaded screw and at its extremity is a cone valve. The steam nozzle has a sleeve on its nut engaging with the thread on this spindle, and the nozzle and nut are free to slide longitudinally, but not revolve, within the injector casing, a gland being used to prevent steam leakage. The combining cone is fixed and divided near the centre of its length by the main overflow gap. The outlet from the overflow chamber is regulated by an automatic valve. There is also an overflow gap between the combining and delivery cones.
The injector body is made in two parts and can easily be taken down, while provision is made for the lubrication of the chief working parts.
When the starting handle is in the closed position the steam nozzle is screwed up to its highest point so that the cone valve on the spindle closes the entrance to the steam nozzle. As the handle is turned the steam nozzle is forced downwards away from the cone valve and nearer to the combining cone. The effect of this movement is at first gradually to open the steam inlet, while the water has practically free access to the combining cone, and later, while the steam passage remains fully open, the lower end of the steam nozzle approaches so close to the combining cone as to reduce the water inlet area, and thus the water supply can be reduced to about one-half of the full delivery.
The injector is restarting and can be used for lifting. With no lift and steam at 160 lb. per sq. in. it can take feed-water at 115° F. (46° C.), or at 135° F. (56° C.) if the pressure is only 50 lb. per sq. in.

The exhaust steam from the engine passes into the ejector through a hand-controlled wing valve, after which part of it passes through the central exhaust steam nozzle and part through the annular nozzle surrounding the draft tube. The combining nozzle is of the flap type, arranged to give a very free outlet, and an automatic hinged valve is fitted to the overflow chamber. When the wing valve is opened steam passes into the injector. When the water, which must be under a slight head, is turned on it passes through the injector to the overflow mixing with the exhaust steam and condensing it, thus causing a partial vacuum which draws in more steam. In this way in a short time the velocity of the steam through the two nozzles is sufficient to give the necessary momentum to the water. The condensation of steam and the giving up of its momentum takes place in two stages, thus increasing efficiency and enabling the delivery pressure to reach as high a value as 120 lb. per sq. in. In other respects the injector works like the usual automatic live steam injector. The water supply is regulated by moving the central exhaust nozzle, which can slide longitudinally within the injector body towards the draft tube, thus reducing the annular area through which the water has to pass. This movement is performed by means of an eccentric pin fitting in a slot on the outside of the nozzle and worked by the external water regulator handle. For working the injector when the engine is not running a live steam connection is provided. The main body of the injector is of cast iron, but all nozzles are of gunmetal and can be easily removed.]

Object entry information: [This shows a self-contained injector designed to work on the same principles as No. 459, but has a double steam nozzle, as patented in 1905 by Messrs. J. C. and R. D. Metcalfe, which renders it particularly suitable for use when the feed-water has to be lifted. It can work with feed-water at temperatures up to 140° F. (60° C.). The steam nozzle comprises an outer annular suction jet and an inner forcing jet. A single handle controls the steam inlet to both nozzles through a conical valve. On the same spindle as the conical valve is a cylindrical valve fitting into the end of the forcing nozzle, and preventing the inlet of steam until the valve spindle has moved through a small distance. This arrangement ensures that, when starting, the lifting jet comes into operation before the forcer. The nozzles are so proportioned that suction is always produced in the feed pipe even with the forcing nozzle in action. The arrangement of the overflow chambers and valves is the same as that in No. 459, but owing to the use of a double nozzle, the end of the forcing nozzle projects within the combining nozzle beyond the first overflow gap. On starting or restarting the overflow from the lifting nozzle escapes through the first gap, and the overflow from the forcer through the hinged flap and thence through the pressure controlled overflow valve. This injector will work with steam pressures from 30 to 300 lb. per sq. in.]

Object entry information: [This is a sectioned example of a self-contained live steam injector for stationary boilers which is automatic and self-starting. It is controlled by two handles only and can work with very hot feed-water owing to the use of overflow chambers controlled by a method patented by Messrs. J. C. and R. D. Metcalfe between 1899 and 1907. The steam supply is regulated by a hand-operated screw-down needle valve at the entrance to the steam nozzle. The combining nozzle is surrounded by two overflow chambers, the first communicating with the interior of the nozzles through a fixed annular gap, while the nozzle in the second or main chamber is provided with a short hinged flap, (a device used on earlier injectors, see, for example, No. 455), which gives a very free overflow when required and yet leaves no gap in the nozzle when the injector is feeding. The overflow gap between the combining and pressure nozzles also opens into the second chamber. The first overflow chamber has an ordinary automatic drop valve fitted between it]

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Lancaster & Tonge, Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The trap shown, which is of the weighted bucket type, was originally patented in 1884 by Mr. H. Lancaster and Mr. R. F. C. Tonge. The example shown is a new design more compact than the old one. The valve at the inlet is a loose disc brought up to its seat by a quick-pitched screw working in the inner valve box owing to its being attached to a float or bucket. There is thus no danger of the valve sticking; in fact, it can act as a safety valve, as any excessive pressure will by virtue of the quick pitch of the screw overcome the resistance of the float. Normally the float is in the lowest position and the valve is full open. After the condensed water has drained through the hollow spindle into the interior of the float, steam follows and drives out the water through the internal pipe. The float, becoming buoyant, rises and closes the valve. The steam inside the float condenses, water from the box flows in through small holes in the float, the latter becomes water-logged and the cycle recommences. To obviate the trouble due to re-evaporation, an adjustable air valve is fitted to the top of the valve-box is provided with a slotted flange to allow of its partial rotation. The trap is made in a number of sizes from 0.375 in. to 3 in. diam. inlet. The example shown is the 0.5 in. diam. size.

Object entry information: The sectioned example shown is a steam trap for a 3 in. pipe, and consists of a cast-iron vessel fitted with two deflectors by which the steam and its contained water are thrown into the lower portion of the vessel where the water settles by gravity. From the chamber the water escapes by a pipe, communicating with an automatic valve so constructed that it will allow the water to pass but not the steam. This is accomplished by using a horizontal iron pipe carrying at its end a hand-wheel and a stop valve, and having within it a copper pipe which carries the seat of the valve at one end but is rigidly fixed only at the opposite extremity. The valve is slightly withdrawn from its seat so as to let the water escape, but when all the water is exhausted and steam enters the copper pipe the greater expansion of copper (about 50 per cent. more than iron) elongates the internal tube sufficiently to close the valve. After a while the further accumulation of water in the collecting chamber cools the copper tube sufficiently to open the valve again. By opening the valve wide, a complete blow through for scouring purposes can be effected.

Date of creation: 1906.
Object entry information: This steam trap, patented in 1893 by Mr. W. Geipel, depends for its action upon the difference in the coefficients of expansion of brass and iron. In the body of the trap are situated two tubes arranged to form two sides of an isosceles triangle; at the apex is situated the valve, whilst the third side is the distance between the ends of the tubes. These ends are fixed in the body of the trap whilst the apex of the triangle is free to move. One end of a spring-controlled lever presses against the valve spindle, which, together with the valve and its seat, is free to move when caused to do so by the expansion of the tubes. The valve is open when the trap is cool, free communication being then established between the steam inlet pipe (brass) and the water outlet (iron). When in use, steam in the brass pipe causes it to expand more than the iron pipe, and the vertex of the triangle, which is practically the valve and its seat, moves, and closes the valves. This position continues until sufficient water collects in the steam pipe to cool it, when its contraction again opens the valve and the water is automatically blown through. Varying pressures of steam are allowed for, as a pressure sufficiently high to cause large movement of the valve would only press the spindle back and compress the spring. The spring is adjusted by means of nuts to keep the valve closed when in use against the normal steam pressure.
This trap may be used in any position, and may be blown through by hand on depressing the lever. The example shown is the smallest size made and has a discharge capacity of 250 gal. per hour.

Object entry information: This is an example of an expansion steam trap patented by Mr. J. E. L. Ogden in 1898, and improved in 1904-5. Its action depends on the expansion and contraction of a tube operating the valve through which the condensed water is discharged.
It consists of a tube of brass, or other metal with a high coefficient of expansion, connected at one end with a valve casing, the other end being secured to a flange attached to the steam piping which it is required to drain. Two iron rods are mounted with their inner ends carried in a collar pivoted on the end flange, and with their outer ends carried, one against the valve casing and the other against the shorter arm of a spring-loaded lever. The lever operating against the steam pressure bears against the discharge valve spindle and keeps the valve closed.
When the trap is cold, it is arranged that the valve is open owing to the pressure of the upper iron rod on the shorter arm of the bellcrank lever. Steam then passes freely through the trap, raising the temperature of the brass tube, which, expanding, relieves the pressure of the iron rod on the lever, and allows the spring to shut the valve. Condensed water then collects in the brass tube, and, as its temperature falls, the tube contracts, thus opening the valve, when the same series of operations recurs. The effect of the expansion of the brass tube is magnified, first by the bellcrank lever having unequal arms, and then it is doubled by having a pair of iron rods and making the collar against which they bear pivot about the end flange on knife edges.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Geipel & Lange,
Date of creation: 1906.
Object entry information: This steam trap, patented in 1893 by Mr. W. Geipel, depends for its action upon the difference in the coefficients of expansion of brass and iron. In the body of the trap are situated two tubes arranged to form two sides of an isosceles triangle; at the apex is situated the valve, whilst the third side is the distance between the ends of the tubes. These ends are fixed in the body of the trap whilst the apex of the triangle is free to move. One end of a spring-controlled lever presses against the valve spindle, which, together with the valve and its seat, is free to move when caused to do so by the expansion of the tubes. The valve is open when the trap is cool, free communication being then established between the steam inlet pipe (brass) and the water outlet (iron). When in use, steam in the brass pipe causes it to expand more than the iron pipe, and the vertex of the triangle, which is practically the valve and its seat, moves, and closes the valves. This position continues until sufficient water collects in the steam pipe to cool it, when its contraction again opens the valve and the water is automatically blown through. Varying pressures of steam are allowed for, as a pressure sufficiently high to cause large movement of the valve would only press the spindle back and compress the spring. The spring is adjusted by means of nuts to keep the valve closed when in use against the normal steam pressure.
This trap may be used in any position, and may be blown through by hand on depressing the lever. The example shown is the smallest size made and has a discharge capacity of 250 gal. per hour.

Date of creation: 1905.
Object entry information: This is an example of an expansion steam trap patented by Mr. J. E. L. Ogden in 1898, and improved in 1904-5. Its action depends on the expansion and contraction of a tube operating the valve through which the condensed water is discharged.
It consists of a tube of brass, or other metal with a high coefficient of expansion, connected at one end with a valve casing, the other end being secured to a flange attached to the steam piping which it is required to drain. Two iron rods are mounted with their inner ends carried in a collar pivoted on the end flange, and with their outer ends carried, one against the valve casing and the other against the shorter arm of a spring-loaded lever. The lever operating against the steam pressure bears against the discharge valve spindle and keeps the valve closed.
When the trap is cold, it is arranged that the valve is open owing to the pressure of the upper iron rod on the shorter arm of the bellcrank lever. Steam then passes freely through the trap, raising the temperature of the brass tube, which, expanding, relieves the pressure of the iron rod on the lever, and allows the spring to shut the valve. Condensed water then collects in the brass tube, and, as its temperature falls, the tube contracts, thus opening the valve, when the same series of operations recurs. The effect of the expansion of the brass tube is magnified, first by the bellcrank lever having unequal arms, and then it is doubled by having a pair of iron rods and making the collar against which they bear pivot about the end flange on knife edges.

Object entry information: 212 deg. F. This water enters the chamber, and flows out through a pipe attached to the other end. The Bourdon tube is of tempered steel and hermetically sealed, but contains a volatile liquid, the pressure of the vapour from which rises very rapidly with increase of temperature, so that the difference in the vapour pressure at 210 deg. F. and 212 deg. F. is sufficient to give a considerable variation in the span of the tube.
The valve and tube are connected together, and pressed by an external set screw against the reaction of a spring towards the valve seat, so that the adjustment can be accurately made. When cool the valve is fully open, so that the steam pipe is drained on starting; the valve remains open until steam enters the trap and causes the Bourdon tube to lengthen so as to completely close the valve, which remains closed until the temperature falls below 212 deg. F.
Unless the discharge from the trap is to be at a higher level the apparatus is free from internal pressure.

Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: This trap, known as the “Unic,” depends for its action on the throttling or labyrinth principle universally used for the gland packing of steam turbines. The working element is a cone of small taper, on the surface of which right and left-handed intersecting helical grooves of either fine or coarse pitch are cut. The cone is placed in a seating next to a chamber into which the condensed water drains, and which is provided with a baffle to throw down impurities. Condensed water fills the chamber and flows through the grooves of the cone to the outlet branch. Steam, however, throttles itself at the intersections of the grooves and is prevented from escaping. The lower part of the first chamber acts as a receptacle for the mud, which can be blown out by opening the by-pass valve. The trap shown, No. 15, is suitable for any pressure up to 240 lb., but is designed for small water capacity only; at 120 lb. pressure its rated capacity is 500 lb. per hour. Its weight is 13 lb. only. For large capacities the trap is made with cones nested one inside another concentrically to as many as five, and in larger sizes 2, 4 or 7 of these nests are arranged in parallel.

Hotchkiss and in the model it is shown as applied to a Lancashire boiler, but it may be fitted on any tubular boiler. It consists of a cast iron spherical vessel, placed on the top of the boiler, preferably at the back end, and connected with it by two stand-pipes, both being continued internally. The up-flow pipe ends in a horizontal funnel-shaped mouth, which is so placed that its lower edge is not higher than the low-water level of the boiler. The mouth is directed to the front end of the boiler in order to receive the surface currents of hot water flowing towards it. The return pipe is continued through the boiler shell as far below the level of the funnel mouth as the construction of the boiler will permit, to the bottom of the spherical vessel a blow-off pipe is led to a convenient place for discharging. When the boiler is in use a continuous circulation is set up through the spherical vessel, convection causing the hot water to rise in the funnel-mouthed pipe, and, becoming cooled, to pass through the return pipe to the bottom of the boiler. The impurities in the boiler water driven to the water level by ebullition are carried with the ascending water into the external and comparatively quiet vessel on the top where the sediment is precipitated. This deposition is assisted by a vertical diaphragm or baffle inside the sphere and cast with it, which prevents undue agitation of

Object entry information: This blower, known as the ""Diamond,"" is for removing the soot from the exterior of tubes and boiler economisers, etc. It consists of a pipe, placed at right angles to, and having a number of jets or nozzles opposite spaces between, the boiler tubes. One end of the tube has a fitting passing through a stuffing-box into a blower head connected with the boiler. This end is toothed externally and engages with a worm wheel. On one end of the spindle of this wheel is a mushroom valve, closing the opening from the boiler, on the other is a collar. The outer end of the jet pipe is supported in a special bearing made to strut between adjacent tubes. The action of turning the worm spindle first screws the valve off its seat, which allows boiler steam to enter; further effort then overcomes the resistance of the jet tube and it moves through a predetermined arc, meanwhile ejecting the steam. On reversing, steam is shut off and the tube is restored to its initial position. The operation occupies only about 1 min. As the jet tube is exposed dry to the furnace gases, it is made of ""Pirek"" metal, which will stand a temperature of 1,000 deg. C. A print shows the method of operating the blower.

It is really a valveless pneumatic hammer, comprising a short heavy piston with grooved packing reciprocating in a cylinder at right angles to the end of the air supply pipe by which it is manipulated. The piston acts as its own valve and in normal working cushions enough air to prevent it coming to rest in the closed position; if this does happen, however, it can be readily restarted by turning over the supply pipe when the piston drops by its own weight. The exterior of the cylinder is serrated to act as a scraper. The example shown is for a tube 1.5 in diameter.

Object entry information: These are steel brushes, known as the ""Simplex,"" for cleaning soot and scale from the inside of boiler tubes, as patented by Mr. A. G. Bromell in 1906. The bristles are short and of steel wire, with sufficient elasticity to prevent deformation if used only for the size of tube for which they are designed. The tool sets steel pads riveted to the arms, which are of stiff steel united to a rod screwed for attachment to the scraper rod. There are two patterns. No. 1 is adjustable in diameter, the arms being bulged by wing nuts on the central rod; these nuts also protect the bristles on entering the tube. This adjustment allows for wear of the bristles. The brush is suitable for tubes 1.5 in to 2.5 in diam. Pattern No. 2 has arms which are flexible enough to allow of its adjusting itself to inequalities in the tube. This brush is suitable for the same range of tubes as the preceding.

Maker/Donor: Lent by The Diamond Blower Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: This blower, known as the ""Diamond,"" is for removing the soot from the exterior of tubes and boiler economisers, etc. It consists of a pipe, placed at right angles to, and having a number of jets or nozzles opposite spaces between, the boiler tubes. One end of the tube has a fitting passing through a stuffing-box into a blower head connected with the boiler. This end is toothed externally and engages with a worm wheel. On one end of the spindle of this wheel is a mushroom valve, closing the opening from the boiler, on the other is a collar. The outer end of the jet pipe is supported in a special bearing made to strut between adjacent tubes. The action of turning the worm spindle first screws the valve off its seat, which allows boiler steam to enter; further effort then overcomes the resistance of the jet tube and it moves through a predetermined arc, meanwhile ejecting the steam. On reversing, steam is shut off and the tube is restored to its initial position. The operation occupies only about 1 min. As the jet tube is exposed dry to the furnace gases, it is made of ""Pirek"" metal, which will stand a temperature of 1,000 deg. C. A print shows the method of operating the blower.

Object entry information: This tool, known as the ""Diamond,"" is for removing the scale deposited on the inside of boiler and economiser tubes. It is really a valveless pneumatic hammer, comprising a short heavy piston with grooved packing reciprocating in a cylinder at right angles to the end of the air supply pipe by which it is manipulated. The piston acts as its own valve and in normal working cushions enough air to prevent it coming to rest in the closed position; if this does happen, however, it can be readily restarted by turning over the supply pipe when the piston drops by its own weight. The exterior of the cylinder is serrated to act as a scraper. The example shown is for a tube 1.5 in diameter.

These compounds are extensively used for covering cylinders, boilers, and steam pipes, with the object of diminishing the serious loss of heat which takes place when the surfaces are exposed to the atmosphere. The materials employed, in addition to being poor conductors, must be incombustible, and when dry should be hard enough to resist a certain amount of rough usage. They are applied, in the form of a paste, to the hot surface to be protected, and, owing to the introduction of a fibrous ingredient, possess sufficient tenacity to remain in a position without additional support; when dry the surface is smoothed down and finally coated with a thick paint, etc., which prevents subsequent softening should water accidentally fall on it.

Object entry information: Lent by Messrs. Newalls Insulation Co., Ltd., 1921. The transfer of heat which takes place when pipes, etc., under steam or refrigerated, are exposed to the atmosphere can be largely obviated by covering them with non-conducting materials. These must have a certain amount of cohesion particularly where exposed to vibration. There are two general methods of application: in one the material is rendered plastic and built up to the required thickness on the hot surface; in the other, the material is made up into sections and fastened on with bands, etc. The former is cheaper, but the latter has the advantage of being removable for inspection. There are many mixtures of clay, etc., with vegetable fibre that reduce the heat loss about 55 per cent. as compared with the bare steam pipe, but the really suitable materials, with their efficiencies, are:—asbestos composition, 70 per cent.; magnesia composition, 78 per cent.; magnesia sections, 82 per cent.; asbestos composition, 87 per cent.; and cork sections, 88 per cent. Such materials or their like, devised to meet widely different conditions, are shown. Asbestos is represented by plastic composition of two grades in bags, and by corrugated paper material for sectional use. Magnesia, on account of its physical properties and of its high insulation value compared with its cost, is a very widely used material. The plastic form in bags, the plain slab, and the material in mattress form are shown. For pipe flanges, the heat loss from which is serious, sheet metal boxes lined with magnesia are used. The insulation in brick and slab for cold storage work, etc., and also canvas-wrapped and banded sections, sheet metal boxes lined with ""Newallite"" and ""Newswulate,"" are compositions used for pipe flanges, etc., and are compositions used for bulkhead insulation, etc. The latter is made up of a layer of composition protected by expanded metal, finished with plastic material and a coat of paint. Cork has the disadvantages of combustibility and cost, but is suitable for cold storage work. It is represented by the slab form, plain and cement-finished; by pipe sections, coated and uncoated; and by flange covers.

These compounds are extensively used for covering cylinders, boilers, and steam pipes, with the object of diminishing the serious loss of heat which takes place when the surfaces are exposed to the atmosphere. The materials employed, in addition to being poor conductors, must be incombustible, and when dry should be hard enough to resist a certain amount of rough usage. They are applied, in the form of a paste, to the hot surface to be protected, and, owing to the introduction of a fibrous ingredient, possess sufficient tenacity to remain in a position without additional support; when dry the surface is smoothed down and finally coated with a thick paint, etc., which prevents subsequent softening should water accidentally fall on it.

Object entry information: Lent by Messrs. Newalls Insulation Co., Ltd., 1921. The transfer of heat which takes place when pipes, etc., under steam or refrigerated, are exposed to the atmosphere can be largely obviated by covering them with non-conducting materials. These must have a certain amount of cohesion particularly where exposed to vibration. There are two general methods of application: in one the material is rendered plastic and built up to the required thickness on the hot surface; in the other, the material is made up into sections and fastened on with bands, etc. The former is cheaper, but the latter has the advantage of being removable for inspection. There are many mixtures of clay, etc., with vegetable fibre that reduce the heat loss about 55 per cent. as compared with the bare steam pipe, but the really suitable materials, with their efficiencies, are:—asbestos composition, 70 per cent.; magnesia composition, 78 per cent.; magnesia sections, 82 per cent.; asbestos composition, 87 per cent.; and cork sections, 88 per cent. Such materials or their like, devised to meet widely different conditions, are shown. Asbestos is represented by plastic composition of two grades in bags, and by corrugated paper material for sectional use. Magnesia, on account of its physical properties and of its high insulation value compared with its cost, is a very widely used material. The plastic form in bags, the plain slab, and the material in mattress form are shown. For pipe flanges, the heat loss from which is serious, sheet metal boxes lined with magnesia are used. The insulation in brick and slab for cold storage work, etc., and also canvas-wrapped and banded sections, sheet metal boxes lined with ""Newallite"" and ""Newswulate,"" are compositions used for pipe flanges, etc., and are compositions used for bulkhead insulation, etc. The latter is made up of a layer of composition protected by expanded metal, finished with plastic material and a coat of paint. Cork has the disadvantages of combustibility and cost, but is suitable for cold storage work. It is represented by the slab form, plain and cement-finished; by pipe sections, coated and uncoated; and by flange covers.

His design is of interest in that it was an attempt to construct an engine working similarly to the theoretically perfect heat engine in which the cycle of operations is closed, the same mass of air being used throughout. The heat was distributed by means of a “displacer” which moved the mass of air to and fro between the hot and cold portions of the apparatus; Stirling also compressed the air before heating it. He was the first to apply a “regenerator” to absorb and restore alternately some of the heat of the mass of working fluid. In these ways he greatly improved the practical efficiency of this class of motor. In the model the furnace portion, probably coke-heated, is missing as in the original.

Object entry information: This engine is of the original type designed by Sir G. Cayley in 1807, in which is employed a closed furnace and two cylinders: a small or cold cylinder, forcing air into and around the furnace, and a larger one into which this heated air is admitted to perform the working strokes, afterwards being discharged into the atmosphere. The model embodies improvements patented by Mr. H. Messer in 1863-4, and has the hot cylinder and the furnace arranged in a rectangular base with the space between them filled with non-conducting material. The furnace itself is a firebrick chamber with a perforated bottom, closed above by a removable charging door. Air from the atmosphere is, by the cold cylinder, pumped into the casing of the furnace, where it is heated, while some of it maintains the combustion of the fuel. The heated air and gases then pass to the hot cylinder, where, on account of their greater volume, they perform much more work than was absorbed in working the air pump, the difference being the available power for overcoming the friction of the engine and doing external work. The cylinders are both single-acting, and are connected with opposite cranks on a shaft above. The admission and exhaust valves of the hot cylinder are of the drop type, and are controlled by cams operated by an eccentric on the crankshaft.

Maker/Donor: Guillaume Amontons. (Prepared in the Museum, 1897.)
Date of creation: 1699.
Object entry information: This design was submitted to the French Academy of Sciences in 1699 by Guillaume Amontons. It shows in section a closed cylindrical copper drum, 31.8 ft. diam. by 12.8 ft. wide, divided into twelve compartments by radial partitions, and containing a smaller concentric wooden drum similarly divided. The partitions of the inner drum are fitted with flap valves and are partially filled with water, while a curved copper pipe leads from each of its chambers to a corresponding chamber of the outer wheel. The drum is mounted on a horizontal axle, and on one side is a furnace to heat the air in the chamber nearest to it, so that the resulting increased pressure and volume being transmitted to the lower cell of the inner or water drum will force the water through the clack into the next higher chamber, and so on, thus continually keeping the water at a higher level on one side of this virtual water wheel than it is on the other, and thereby causing the drum to revolve. After the heated air had done its work it was to be cooled by the water in which the lower part of the drum was immersed. Amontons estimated that the above apparatus was to be equivalent to no less than thirty-nine horses, but his determination of the working capability of a horse was about 14,000 foot pounds per minute; this he considered was equal to the effort of six men.

Object entry information: This is a hot-air engine of the open cycle type in which air is admitted, compressed, heated and exhausted. It was patented in 1855 by John Ericsson, who had worked on the subject since 1825, had patented his first engine in 1833, and in 1852 had built some very large engines for ship propulsion with cylinders 14 ft. diam. The engine shown was made about 1869, and remained in use 30 years.

A cast-iron furnace chamber with grate bars and removable linings projects inside a prolongation of the working cylinder. The products of combustion pass through a lagged jacket surrounding the furnace part of the cylinder before passing away to the flue.

In the cylinder move an outer leather-packed working piston and an inner displacer piston both connected with the crankshaft by link work which causes them to move in different phases to one another, and gives them different lengths of stroke. In the inward stroke cold air is drawn in, through weighted non-return valves in the working piston, into the space between it and the displacer, the exhaust valve being lifted meanwhile by a cam. When the displacer has completed 0·9 of its stroke, but the working piston 0·4 of its stroke, the air is compressed between the pistons and in the space round the furnace. To ensure the air being thoroughly heated a sheet iron prolongation of the displacer works into the annular space between the chamber and a baffle cylinder, the compression and heating of the air causes the return or working stroke, the piston undergoing the same phases as before, but in the reverse direction, till at the end of their strokes they are close together, and the air between them has been transferred through an annular non-return valve in the displacer, to the space round the furnace. The speed of the engine is controlled by a centrifugal governor, opening a waste valve. To stop the engine the exhaust valve can be opened by hand.

The cylinder is 15 in. diam.; the working piston has a stroke of 6·75 in., and the displacer 11·5 in. The engine is said to have developed 1 h.p.

It has two vertical plungers of equal diameter, connected with two overhanging cranks set at right angles on a fly-wheel shaft. The plungers work within two cylindrical chambers, one chamber being kept cool by a water-jacket, and the other being heated from below by a furnace, which, in the model, is replaced by a gas burner. The two chambers are in free communication by a connecting box, which, however, is filled with a number of thin cast-iron plates, so that a large expanse of metal surface is presented to any air passing through the box, which is the regenerator. The stroke of the hot plunger is considerably longer than that of the cold one, so that although the pressures under the plungers are always equal, the volume displaced by the hot plunger is the greater. A constant weight of air is enclosed between the two plungers, but as the crankshaft revolves this arrangement of the cranks is such that during the upward stroke of the hot plunger more of the air is in the hot chamber, and consequently the common pressure is higher than when the plungers are returning. The difference between the power exerted in the upward strokes and that absorbed by the return strokes gives the useful work.

Object name: MODEL OF RIDER'S HOT-AIR ENGINE. (Scale 1: 2.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by Messrs. Hayward-Tyler & Co.
Date of creation: 1887.
Object entry information: This regenerative hot-air engine was patented by Mr. A. K. Rider in 1871–7. It has two vertical plungers of equal diameter, connected with two overhanging cranks set at right angles on a fly-wheel shaft. The plungers work within two cylindrical chambers, one chamber being kept cool by a water-jacket, and the other being heated from below by a furnace, which, in the model, is replaced by a gas burner. The two chambers are in free communication by a connecting box, which, however, is filled with a number of thin cast-iron plates, so that a large expanse of metal surface is presented to any air passing through the box, which is the regenerator. The stroke of the hot plunger is considerably longer than that of the cold one, so that although the pressures under the plungers are always equal, the volume displaced by the hot plunger is the greater. A constant weight of air is enclosed between the two plungers, but as the crankshaft revolves this arrangement of the cranks is such that during the upward stroke of the hot plunger more of the air is in the hot chamber, and consequently the common pressure is higher than when the plungers are returning. The difference between the power exerted in the upward strokes and that absorbed by the return strokes gives the useful work. In passing through the regenerator the air from the hot chamber leaves some of its heat, which it absorbs again on its return passage, the same air being passed backward and forward continuously, and its pressure rising and falling with each revolution. To replace any loss through leakage a small air valve opening inward is fitted, and through this air enters if at any portion of the cycle the internal pressure falls below that of the atmosphere.

Date of creation: 1889.
Object entry information: This engine is of the type originally patented in 1807 by Sir George Cayley, but in the form shown was commercially introduced by Mr. Buckett about 1880. The engine has a cold-air cylinder above the crankshaft, and a large hot-air cylinder below, while the furnace is on one side enclosed in an air-tight chamber; the fuel when required is supplied through a valve and distributing cone arranged above the furnace and provided with an air lock in which the fuel is stored. The speed is controlled by a governor and slide valve by which the air, pumped from the atmosphere by the upper cylinder, is distributed between the firebox and the ashpit, thus regulating the rate of combustion according to the work being done. The supply of heated air and the products of combustion pass from the furnace to the lower cylinder; the former is controlled by a drop valve worked from a cam on the crankshaft, a similar valve controlling the exhaust. At a trial of a double engine of this type, with cylinders 18 in. and 24 in. diam. by 16 in. stroke, the gross indicated h.p. was 41·2, of which the pump used 21, leaving 20·2 effective h.p., of which 14·4, or 71 per cent., was obtained at the brake. The mean pressures on the pistons were 16·7 and 18·5 lb. per sq. in. respectively, and the coke consumption was 2·54 lb. per brake h.p.

Object entry information: This engine is of the construction patented by Mr. R. M. Lowne in 1889 and 1897. The motive power is obtained by drawing a flame into a cylinder and then cooling the hot gases so that they contract, form a partial vacuum, and allow the atmospheric pressure to force in the piston. The engine is provided with a vertical water-jacketed single-acting cylinder, and a trunk piston working through a gland packed with asbestos and having a thin steel band for a rubbing surface. The inner end of the trunk is guided by a ring fitting the cylinder and the outer end by guides on the framing. The flap valve at the top of the cylinder is open during the down-stroke of the piston, and the gas or other flame arranged to play around its seating is drawn into the cylinder; it closes before the end of the stroke, allowing the imprisoned gases to burn out and cool down in time for the up, or working-stroke.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. A. E. & H. Robinson & Co., 1914.
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: This is an example of the low-power hot-air engine patented by Mr. H. Robinson between 1881 and 1890; it is a modification of the regenerative engine invented by Dr. R. Stirling in 1816.
The working cylinder, 4.5 in. diam. by 2.75 in. stroke, is placed horizontally, while the displacer cylinder, 6.5 in. diam. by 1.87 in. stroke, is placed vertically in front of and below it. The upper end of the displacer cylinder is made of cast iron, and is kept cool by a water-jacket. The lower part is of thin sheet brass, and projects into the furnace chamber, where it is heated by a gas flame. A port connects the working cylinder with the displacer cylinder. The working piston drives a crank on a horizontal shaft, and this crank is connected by a link to a horizontal lever above it, the other end of which is pivoted to a lug on top of the cylinder. A slotted link, hanging from an intermediate point in the lever, embraces the connecting rod and is connected with the displacer rod below. The displacer itself is a hollow piston with perforated ends, fitting loosely in its cylinder, and filled with fine tangled wire which acts as a regenerator for economising heat. Its motion, due to the link connections, is about 90 deg. in advance of that of the working piston, so that when the latter is at the back end of its cylinder and commencing to move outward the displacer is at mid-stroke and rising. The air is then passing from the cool upper part to the hot lower chamber, where it is heated and, expanding, exerts a pressure on the working piston driving it outwards. The air also takes up some heat from the wire in the displacer through which it passes. This action continues while the displacer rises to the top and the working piston reaches mid stroke. The displacer then begins to descend and the hot air below is transferred to the cool end, leaving some of its heat in the wire. By the time the working piston has reached the outer end of its stroke the air has contracted, the consequent fall in pressure causing the piston to return.
The speed is controlled by a governor valve fitted to the circular air inlet of the working cylinder; this consists of a tin cone, which is drawn forward so as to partially close the inlet when the velocity increases beyond the normal. The valve is fixed to a spindle passing through the cylinder cover, and is normally held open by a light, adjustable spring. The same air is used continually, any slight loss being made up by air leaking in past the governor valve spindle.
The engine runs at from 200 to 250 rev. per min., and develops about 0.023 brake h.p.

Object entry information: This engine was patented by Monsieur P. Hugon in 1865, but he had then been working at the subject for some years. The only important difference between it and the Lenoir is that the ignition is accomplished by an external flame, instead of by electricity; it was, in fact, the first engine in which ignition by flame was successfully accomplished. The igniting flame is carried to and fro in a cavity inside a slide valve, moved by a cam so as to get a rapid cut-off, and permanent lights are maintained at the ends of the valve to relight the flame ports after each explosion. The gas was supplied to the cylinder by rubber bellows, worked by an eccentric on the crankshaft, but this arrangement is now imperfect. This engine has a cylinder 8.2 in. diam. by 10 in. stroke, and was nominally of 0.5 h.p. It worked in this Museum from 1868 to 1880, and at 75 rev. per min. indicated 0.78 h.p., with a mean pressure of 3.9 lb. per sq. in., and a maximum of 25 lb. Prof. Tresca found the gas consumption in a similar example to be 85 cub. ft. per brake h.p. hour.

Object entry information: The feature of this engine is that it has a “free” piston—an arrangement that was first proposed for a gas engine in 1857, but only brought into a practical form by Herr E. Langen and N. A. Otto under their patent of 1866. The machine was noisy and limited to small sizes, but the gas consumption, being much less than in any previous form of engine, led to its extensive adoption, so that it is generally considered to be the first commercially successful gas engine. The example shown was the first engine of the kind made in Britain. The cycle of operations in the engine is as follows:— (a) The piston is lifted about one-tenth of its travel by the momentum of the fly-wheel, thus drawing in a charge of gas and air. (b) The charge is ignited by flame carried in by a slide valve. (c) Under the impulse of the explosion, the piston shoots upward nearly to the top of the cylinder, the pressure in which falls by expansion to about 4 lb. absolute, while absorbing the energy of the piston. (d) The piston descends by its own weight and the atmospheric pressure, and in so doing causes a roller clutch on a spur wheel gearing with a rack on the piston rod to engage, so that the fly-wheel shaft shall be driven by the piston; during this down-stroke the pressure increases from 4 lb. absolute to that of the atmosphere, and averages 7 lb. per sq. in. effective throughout the stroke. (e) When the piston is near the bottom of the cylinder, the pressure rises above atmospheric, and the stroke is completed by the weight of the piston and rack, and the products of combustion are expelled. (f) The fly-wheel now continues running freely till its speed, as determined by a centrifugal governor, falls below a certain limit when a trip gear causes the piston to be lifted the short distance required to recommence the cycle. Ignition is performed by an external gas jet, near a pocket in the slide valve by which the charge is admitted; this pocket carries a flame to the charge, thus igniting it without allowing any to escape. The valve also connects the interior of the cylinder with the exhaust pipe, and a valve in the latter controlled by the governor throttles the discharge, and so defers the next stroke until the speed has fallen below normal. To run the engine empty about four explosions per minute are necessary, and at full power 30 to 35 are made, so that about 28 explosions per minute are available for useful work under the control of the governor.

The cylinder and covers are cooled by circulating water. The spark for firing was supplied by two Bunsen batteries and an induction coil, the circuit being completed at the right intervals by contact pieces on an insulating disc on the crankshaft; the ignition sparks leaped across the space between two wires carried 0.15 in. apart in a porcelain holder. The engine shown is of 0.5 nominal h.p., and was used for two-and-a-half years in this Museum. The cylinder is 5.5 in. diam. by 8.5 in. stroke, and at 110 rev. per. min. indicated 1 h.p. Prof. Tresca found that a 1 h.p. engine of this type used 96 cub. ft. of Paris gas per h.p. per hour, at 94 rev. per min., the charge being 7.5 of air to one of gas.

Object entry information: This form of gas engine was patented by Mr. S. Ford in 1874. The working chamber is a water-jacketed horizontal cylinder, with a crescent-shaped block or abutment secured to it on one side. Concentric with the cylinder is a fly-wheel shaft, carrying within the chamber a cylindrical drum, the diameter of which is such that the drum touches the abutment. Through the drum is a longitudinal diametral slot, fitted with two blades or pistons, which, by an intervening spring, mutually press outwards, but the shape of the abutment was intended to give a constant diameter, while the spring secured an elastic contact. As the shaft revolves, this diametral piston is forced to and fro by the interior surface of the chamber, and with the abutment divides the volume into three portions of continually varying dimensions. By the revolution of the piston, gas and air are drawn into the chamber through a port at the bottom of the cylinder, and a little later an external flame explodes the mixture, generating a pressure which, acting on the unbalanced area of one blade, causes the fly-wheel shaft to revolve. After thus doing work, the products of combustion escape through an outlet at the top of the chamber. There are two explosions per revolution, but, in common with all engines of its time, there is no compression of the charge before ignition. The admission of gas and air to the cylinder is controlled by a semi-rotary plug valve, which also shuts off the intermittent igniting flame, the latter being re-lit after the explosion by a permanent light at the side. This valve is driven by a cam on the fly-wheel shaft; the exhaust outlet has no valve, but is shut off periodically by the revolving piston. It is stated that the engine ran at about 100 rev. per min., and gave off 0.3 brake h.p., with a gas consumption about the same as that of the Hugon engine.

Object entry information: This is a small example of the first silent high-speed gas engine, and was constructed under the patent obtained by Dr. N. A. Otto in 1876. It works on the “Otto,” or four-stroke cycle, now so very largely used in gas engines, by which silent working and a great reduction in the gas consumption are simultaneously effected. Although Dr. Otto was the first to construct and introduce practically an engine working in this way, the scheme had been proposed by Mons. A. Beau de Rochas in a treatise published in 1862, so that this cycle sometimes bears his name. The engine is single-acting, and when exerting its full power makes one explosion or working stroke in every four strokes; the first outward stroke draws in a cylinder-full of gas and air, which, in the second or return stroke is compressed into the clearance space left at the back of the cylinder; at the commencement of the second out-stroke this compressed charge is fired, the resulting high pressure driving the piston through the third stroke, and by transmitting much energy to the fly-wheel.

By compressing the charge before firing it, nearly doubling the amount of air that otherwise would be permissible, the mixture without preventing its being ignited, this additional cushion moderating the violence of the explosion and giving a more sustained pressure during the working stroke.
The cylinder is water-jacketed, and the gas and air are admitted by a slide valve, which serves also as an igniting valve by carrying a pocket of flame from an external light to a small port ; the exhaust valve is of the drop type, and is placed at the side of the cylinder. Both valves are actuated by a shaft driven by gearing at one-half the speed of the crankshaft. In later practice slide valves have been displaced by those of the drop type, and the ignition is generally performed by a porcelain tube heated to redness, or by an external gas jet.

Date of creation: 1889
Object entry information: The chief feature of this engine is that it is of the six-stroke type, i.e., it has one explosion stroke in six working strokes (see also No. 506).
The engine was made in 1889 under the patent of 1883 of Mr. S. Griffin. The cycle was as follows :—(1) admission of charge, (2) compression, (3) explosion and expansion, (4) expulsion of products of combustion, (5) drawing in of scavenging air charge, (6) expulsion of scavenging charge. The defects of this cycle are, the want of regularity in speed and small power in proportion to size owing to the small number of ignitions. These disadvantages were to a certain extent obviated in the more usual Griffin construction in which the cylinder was horizontal and made double-acting, whereby it became virtually a 3-cycle engine. Indeed, twin-cylinder engines of this type were even installed for electric lighting. In that case the cycle of one engine was three strokes in advance of the other.
The engine is vertical of 0.5 h.p. The cylinder is water-jacketed 4.5 in. diam. by 9 in. stroke. The gas supply has a cock graduated for hand adjustment. The supply is controlled by a cam on a shaft spur geared 3 : 1 from the crank-shaft with hit-and-miss regulation by a spring-controlled centrifugal governor. The gas to the cylinder is timed by a slide valve moved by an eccentric on the 3 : 1 shaft. Ignition is by tube. The exhaust and scavenger air valve is controlled by a cam on the 3 : 1 shaft. At the rated speed of 240 rev. per min., the brake h.p. was 1.26, with a consumption of 38 cub. ft. of gas per h.p. per hour ; when running light, 19 cub. ft. were required.
At the trials of the Society of Arts in 1888, a double-acting single-cylinder horizontal engine of this type, 9 in. diam. by 14 in. stroke, indicated 15.5 h.p. at 198 rev. per min., with a consumption of gas of 28 cub. ft. per brake h.p. per hour. The mechanical efficiency was 81 per cent. and the thermal efficiency 14 per cent.

Object entry information: This represents an engine introduced by Mr. J. Atkinson in 1886 as an improved machine for obtaining the same action as was secured in his “differential” engine, No. 499. The engine has one cylinder, and is single-acting, but by a peculiar arrangement of links two double strokes are made for one revolution of the fly-wheel, and as it is a compression engine this gives one impulse per revolution. The connecting rod from the piston is attached to a crank arm, which only vibrates through an angle of 90 deg., while from the pin of this crank another connecting rod passes upwards to the crankpin of the fly-wheel shaft; this connecting rod is triangular, having three pin joints. The result of this arrangement of mechanism is that the explosion stroke is about twice the length of the compression one, so that a considerable degree of useful expansion, with corresponding economy, is secured. The cylinder is water-jacketed, and tube ignition is employed. The engine represented was of 6 h.p., with a cylinder 9·5 in. diam. and a crank throw of 12·5 in., which, running at 131 rev. per min., exerted 9·5 brake h.p., with a gas consumption of 22·6 cub. ft. per brake h.p. hour.

Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This is a diagrammatic model illustrating the chief features of an internal combustion engine working on the “Otto,” or four-stroke cycle. The piston is single-acting, and in its first out-stroke draws in gas and air through two drop valves worked by a lever from a cam on a shaft running at half the speed of the crankshaft. In the return stroke these mixed gases are compressed into the clearance space at the end of the cylinder, and at the commencement of the second out-stroke are fired by a red hot tube with which they are then placed in communication. During this “explosion” stroke the piston is being forced outwards under a high but rapidly diminishing pressure, the energy thus transmitted to the crankshaft being chiefly absorbed by the fly-wheel which subsequently delivers it as driving power during the two revolutions which are included in the cycle. The speed of the engine is regulated by an inertia governor which completely cuts off the supply of gas when the normal speed is exceeded, so that there is no explosion, and the subsequent two strokes are performed entirely by the energy in the fly-wheel. This governor is in the form of a spring-controlled weight, hinged to the gas admission lever, and so arranged that if the admission lever is flicked by the cam with more than the normal velocity a tappet attached to the weighted portion fails to engage with the gas admission valve. The cylinder is enclosed by a jacket through which water is circulated, in order to prevent the working parts from reaching a temperature that would rapidly destroy them; this at present necessary cooling, however, carries off about 30 to 40 per cent. of the available energy generated by the combustion of gas.

Object name: MODEL OF “OTTO” GAS ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Made by Messrs. G. Cussons, Ltd., 1902.
Date of creation: 1902
Object entry information: This is a diagrammatic model illustrating the chief features of an internal combustion engine working on the “Otto,” or four-stroke cycle. The piston is single-acting, and in its first out-stroke draws in gas and air through two drop valves worked by a lever from a cam on a shaft running at half the speed of the crankshaft. In the return stroke these mixed gases are compressed into the clearance space at the end of the cylinder, and at the commencement of the second out-stroke are fired by a red hot tube with which they are then placed in communication. During this “explosion” stroke the piston is being forced outwards under a high but rapidly diminishing pressure, the energy thus transmitted to the crankshaft being chiefly absorbed by the fly-wheel which subsequently delivers it as driving power during the two revolutions which are included in the cycle. The speed of the engine is regulated by an inertia governor which completely cuts off the supply of gas when the normal speed is exceeded, so that there is no explosion, and the subsequent two strokes are performed entirely by the energy in the fly-wheel. This governor is in the form of a spring-controlled weight, hinged to the gas admission lever, and so arranged that if the admission lever is flicked by the cam with more than the normal velocity a tappet attached to the weighted portion fails to engage with the gas admission valve. The cylinder is enclosed by a jacket through which water is circulated, in order to prevent the working parts from reaching a temperature that would rapidly destroy them; this at present necessary cooling, however, carries off about 30 to 40 per cent. of the available energy generated by the combustion of gas.

Date of creation: 1914
Object entry information: This is a small experimental valveless engine patented by Messrs. J. Day and F. W. C. Cock in 1891 and 1892. It operates on the two-stroke cycle patented by Sir Dugald Clerk in 1881, but has no valves, the distribution being performed by the passage of the piston over ports formed through the cylinder walls. The engine has a single vertical cylinder, 2 in. diam. by 3·25 in. stroke, and developed about 1 h.p. The cylinder has a liner forming a water-jacket,

Maker/Donor: Lent by the Still Engine Co.,
Date of creation: 1921.
Object entry information: The engine, of which the thermal cycle diagram is shown, is the result of the labours from 1910 onwards of Mr. W. J. Still. Its feature is that the low thermal cycle of the steam engine, obtained from the rejected heat of an internal combustion engine, is superadded on to the superior thermal cycle of the latter, with the result that the thermal efficiency is higher than that of any other heat engine.
As shown by the diagram, the engine uses in its main cylinder any available form of gaseous or liquid fuel on the four or the two-stroke cycle. It makes use of the heat which passes away in the exhaust gases or through the cylinder walls for the evaporation of steam ; this steam is expanded in the same cylinder on the other side of the piston and finally can be condensed.
Many advantages follow this interaction of internal combustion and steam practice ; an addition of from 40 to 29 per cent. of the brake h.p. according as a condenser is used or not, is obtained ; frictional losses are reduced and the mechanical efficiency is higher ; the piston is cooler and the mean temperature of the cylinder walls is higher ; the superior working advantage of the steam engine is retained.

Object name: MODEL OF PRESSURE GAS PLANT. (Scale 1:8.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by the Dowson Economic Gas and Power Co.,
Date of creation: 1895.
Object entry information: This represents a complete plant for producing heating gas by the method introduced by Mr. J. E. Dowson in 1883. The gas is prepared by passing a current of steam and atmospheric air upwards through a mass of red hot coke or coal, which results in the delivering above the furnace of a mixed gas, containing from 15 to 25 per cent. of hydrogen and 20 to 25 per cent. of carbon monoxide, the remainder consisting of inert gases. This “producer gas,” although not suited for lighting, can be used for general heating purposes, and can be also employed for driving gas engines, a method of obtaining power that has been found very economical ; a horse power being obtained with a consumption of 1 to 1·5 lb. of anthracite coal per hour.
The plant shown consists of a small vertical steam boiler supplying steam to a form of injector, which induces an air current that, together with the steam, enters the ash pit of a vertical firebrick lined chamber, known as the generator. The generator is provided with a closed charging hopper at the top for introducing the fuel, and the grate is maintained covered with a thick fire, in passing through which the steam is decomposed while the combustion of the fuel is supported by the air also carried in. The gas produced is cooled and purified by being led from the generator to a hydraulic box, then through a coke scrubber and a sawdust scrubber to the gas holder, from which it is withdrawn as required. The gas holder is only introduced to correct any irregularity in the working of the plant and is consequently small ; it has been arranged so that the position of the holder should control the admission of steam to the injector, thus automatically adjusting the production of gas to the consumption.
The calorific value of this gas is about 25 per cent. that of coal gas, but it is stated that the cost, including fuel, wages, etc., is only 9 to 12 pence for the equivalent in heating power of 1,000 c. ft. of ordinary town gas. The model represents a plant capable of supplying gas to an engine indicating 50 h.p.

Leon Benier, of Paris, who designed the first plant of this kind in 1894. It follows that the production of gas is automatic and that the pressure in the plant is below that of the atmosphere, so that danger from gas leakage is absent. Benier provided the engine with a separate pump for suction, but it is now found that, if the generator be not too far from the engine, the suction stroke of the latter is all that is necessary. A suction gas plant costs less, is simpler to work and requires less labour than a pressure plant, but suction is of less calorific power than pressure gas.
The plant consists essentially of a generator and a scrubber. The former part has a hopper to feed in the non-bituminous fuel, i.e., charcoal, anthracite or coke, which is used; below this is a fuel-container, whence the fuel falls into a firebrick lined producer provided with a grate and closed ashpit. Around the fuel-container is an annular space, through which the hot gases pass. Bounding this annular space is a ribbed cast-iron vaporiser, of the form patented in 1906 by Messrs. H. N. Bickerton and P. W. Robson. Water is caused to trickle over the exterior of the vaporiser to form steam; thus it works on the flash principle and the steam can be easily regulated—an important factor in working. The vaporiser can easily be scaled, as the surrounding shell is removable. The sensible heat of the outgoing gases is further used in warming the incoming air and feed-water; the former mixes with the steam in the vaporiser and they pass together into the ashpit. The gas then passes by a pipe with a water seal to a scrubber filled with coke over which a stream of water from a sprinkler pipe and distributing dish is continually trickling. The clean and cool gas finally passes to the engine. When starting the plant, a centrifugal fan, worked by hand, is used for blowing the producer, and the gases generated are allowed to pass with the air by opening the cock on the open vertical pipe.
In tests of suction gas plants made at Derby in 1906 for the Royal Agricultural Society, a 20 brake h.p. “National” plant showed a consumption per brake h.p. per hour of 1·04 lb. anthracite coal and 1·14 gal. of water. For its design and performance it received the highest award—a gold medal.

Maker/Donor: Lent by J. H. Knight, Esq., 1891.
Date of creation: 1891
Object entry information: In this engine, patented by Mr. Knight in 1887–91, vaporised petroleum instead of gas is used in forming the explosive mixture. The petroleum oil is vaporised in a chamber at the back of the working or combustion cylinder, the temperature being maintained by the cylinder being sufficient for this purpose; but when starting cold a special paraffin lamp situated under the chamber is lighted, and in about a quarter of an hour heats the vaporising chamber to the requisite temperature for starting, when it may be extinguished. This arrangement was adopted in the “Trusty” oil engine.
The engine is single-acting and has a cycle of six strokes, two being added for scavenging. The charge is ignited by a wire helix mounted on the slide valve. The helix is maintained white hot by a mineral oil blow-pipe worked from a bellows at the side of the engine, and at the right instant the valve carries the helix from the flame and slides it over a cylinder port, thus placing it in the already compressed explosive charge. The governor acts by regulating the quantity of oil fed into the vaporising chamber by the small pump which forces it from the reservoir in the engine bed.
The motor shown is of 0·5 h.p., and it is stated that 1 lb. of petroleum consumed in it does the same amount of work as 2 to 2·5 lb. of coal in a steam plant of similar power.

Object name: MODEL OF SUCTION GAS PLANT. (Scale about 1:8.)
Maker/Donor: Lent by the National Gas Engine Co., Ltd., 1910.
Date of creation: 1910
Object entry information: The idea of working a gas producer, used in conjunction with a gas engine for power purposes, by means of suction induced by the engine itself, instead of by steam pressure, is due to Mons. Leon Benier, of Paris, who designed the first plant of this kind in 1894. It follows that the production of gas is automatic and that the pressure in the plant is below that of the atmosphere, so that danger from gas leakage is absent. Benier provided the engine with a separate pump for suction, but it is now found that, if the generator be not too far from the engine, the suction stroke of the latter is all that is necessary. A suction gas plant costs less, is simpler to work and requires less labour than a pressure plant, but suction is of less calorific power than pressure gas.
The plant consists essentially of a generator and a scrubber. The former part has a hopper to feed in the non-bituminous fuel, i.e., charcoal, anthracite or coke, which is used; below this is a fuel-container, whence the fuel falls into a firebrick lined producer provided with a grate and closed ashpit. Around the fuel-container is an annular space, through which the hot gases pass. Bounding this annular space is a ribbed cast-iron vaporiser, of the form patented in 1906 by Messrs. H. N. Bickerton and P. W. Robson. Water is caused to trickle over the exterior of the vaporiser to form steam; thus it works on the flash principle and the steam can be easily regulated—an important factor in working. The vaporiser can easily be scaled, as the surrounding shell is removable. The sensible heat of the outgoing gases is further used in warming the incoming air and feed-water; the former mixes with the steam in the vaporiser and they pass together into the ashpit. The gas then passes by a pipe with a water seal to a scrubber filled with coke over which a stream of water from a sprinkler pipe and distributing dish is continually trickling. The clean and cool gas finally passes to the engine. When starting the plant, a centrifugal fan, worked by hand, is used for blowing the producer, and the gases generated are allowed to pass with the air by opening the cock on the open vertical pipe.
In tests of suction gas plants made at Derby in 1906 for the Royal Agricultural Society, a 20 brake h.p. “National” plant showed a consumption per brake h.p. per hour of 1·04 lb. anthracite coal and 1·14 gal. of water. For its design and performance it received the highest award—a gold medal.
These plants are made in sizes up to 300 h.p.

Object name: PETROLEUM ENGINE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by J. H. Knight, Esq., 1891.
Date of creation: 1891
Object entry information: In this engine, patented by Mr. Knight in 1887–91, vaporised petroleum instead of gas is used in forming the explosive mixture. The petroleum oil is vaporised in a chamber at the back of the working or combustion cylinder, the temperature being maintained by the cylinder being sufficient for this purpose; but when starting cold a special paraffin lamp situated under the chamber is lighted, and in about a quarter of an hour heats the vaporising chamber to the requisite temperature for starting, when it may be extinguished. This arrangement was adopted in the “Trusty” oil engine.
The engine is single-acting and has a cycle of six strokes, two being added for scavenging. The charge is ignited by a wire helix mounted on the slide valve. The helix is maintained white hot by a mineral oil blow-pipe worked from a bellows at the side of the engine, and at the right instant the valve carries the helix from the flame and slides it over a cylinder port, thus placing it in the already compressed explosive charge. The governor acts by regulating the quantity of oil fed into the vaporising chamber by the small pump which forces it from the reservoir in the engine bed.
The motor shown is of 0·5 h.p., and it is stated that 1 lb. of petroleum consumed in it does the same amount of work as 2 to 2·5 lb. of coal in a steam plant of similar power.

Date of creation: 1920.
Object entry information: This represents, in section, an oil engine patented by Mr. Stuart in 1890. In it the fuel oil is sprayed into pure air at the end of the compression stroke and is automatically ignited by a vaporiser or hot bulb extension to the cylinder end. An external lamp is required when starting, but this can be dispensed with when running, as the bulb is then kept hot by the explosions. The same cycle was afterwards adopted in the Diesel engine, except that the latter employed a much higher compression which raised the temperature of the air high enough to ignite the fuel without external or other heating. The so-called semi-diesel engine, however, works precisely on this Akroyd cycle.
The cylinder is horizontal, 9⋅25 in. diam. by 16 in. stroke, the liner fitting within a jacket casing which is cast in one with the bed plate and crank shaft bearings. The hot bulb is bolted to the cylinder end, there being a narrow neck at the junction. On the suction stroke air alone enters through a spring-loaded automatic valve at the end of the bulb, and is compressed on the succeeding stroke. The fuel oil is lifted from a tank in the bed by a pump driven by spur gearing and a cam at half the speed of the crank shaft; it is delivered to a nozzle in the hot bulb where a finger in front of the nozzle serves to spray the fuel. Fins are cast across the upper part of the hot bulb to facilitate the ignition. The exhaust valve is placed below the cylinder and is operated by a lever and cam. Speed regulation is effected by a centrifugal governor which acts on a valve in the suction pipe of the oil pump.
An alternative form of hot bulb with a water or oil jacketed throat, patented by Mr. Stuart in 1892, is also shown.

The cycle consists of four strokes, during the first of which the piston moves outwards and draws air alone into the cylinder through the inlet valve; on the second stroke the piston moves inwards and compresses this air to a pressure of about 500 lb. per sq. in. At the beginning of the third, or working stroke, the oil fuel is injected into the cylinder, through a special needle valve, by an air blast at a pressure of about 650 lb. per sq. in., and it there burns quietly at constant pressure during the short admission period and expands to the final pressure during the remainder of the stroke. On the fourth stroke the products of combustion are expelled through the exhaust valve. The temperature of the compressed air is so high that no other ignition apparatus is required and almost any kind of crude fuel oil can be completely burned, while even coal dust has been employed. The quantity of air in the cylinder is greater than that required for complete combustion of the fuel injected, in order to prevent the temperature from rising too high.

The engine shown has a single water-jacketed vertical cylinder 100 mm. (3·94 in.) diam. by 140 mm. (5·52 in.) stroke, and develops 5 h.p. when running at 600 rev. per min., on a fuel consumption of 0·53 lb. per brake h.p. per hour. The cylinder has a trunk piston and is bolted to a closed crank chamber forming the engine bed. The three working valves, and the air starting valve, are all fitted in the cylinder head, and are operated, through rocking levers and long tappet rods, by a transverse camshaft placed just above the crankshaft. The compressed air for the fuel injection and starting is supplied by an air pump placed beside the working cylinder, and having its piston driven by a crank on the main shaft. The fuel air passes directly to its valve, while that for starting is stored in steel reservoirs fixed beside the engine. The fuel is supplied to the injection valve by a small pump driven from the end of the camshaft and the quantity delivered is controlled by a centrifugal governor acting on a by-pass valve. When starting, a cam acting on the starting valve is brought into operation and compressed air is admitted to drive the engine for a few revolutions, when the valve is again put out of action.

The thermal efficiency of the Diesel engine is rather higher than that of the explosion gas engine, and has reached 40 per cent., but the mechanical efficiency being lower reduces the brake thermal efficiency to a maximum of about 32 per cent., which is comparable with that of the gas engine. The mean effective pressure in the cylinder is from 110 to 120 lb. per sq. in., and a fuel consumption, at full load, of slightly over 0·4 lb. of oil per b.h.p. hour has been attained.","Inv. 1914-87, S.M. 601.","Continuation from previous page: TRUE

(5·52 in.) stroke, and develops 5 h.p. when running at 600 rev. per min., on a fuel consumption of 0·53 lb. per brake h.p. per hour. The cylinder has a trunk piston and is bolted to a closed crank chamber forming the engine bed. The three working valves, and the air starting valve, are all fitted in the cylinder head, and are operated, through rocking levers and long tappet rods, by a transverse camshaft placed just above the crankshaft. The compressed air for the fuel injection and starting is supplied by an air pump placed beside the working cylinder, and having its piston driven by a crank on the main shaft. The fuel air passes directly to its valve, while that for starting is stored in steel reservoirs fixed beside the engine. The fuel is supplied to the injection valve by a small pump driven from the end of the camshaft and the quantity delivered is controlled by a centrifugal governor acting on a by-pass valve. When starting, a cam acting on the starting valve is brought into operation and compressed air is admitted to drive the engine for a few revolutions, when the valve is again put out of action.

The thermal efficiency of the Diesel engine is rather higher than that of the explosion gas engine, and has reached 40 per cent., but the mechanical efficiency being lower reduces the brake thermal efficiency to a maximum of about 32 per cent., which is comparable with that of the gas engine. The mean effective pressure in the cylinder is from 110 to 120 lb. per sq. in., and a fuel consumption, at full load, of slightly over 0·4 lb. of oil per b.h.p. hour has been attained.

Object entry information: This is a section of the cylinder head of the firm’s “atomiser” oil engine, 1915 model, which was developed by experimental work from 1912 onwards and by experience gained with previous successive engines of 1909, 1906 and 1897. The fuel oil is injected into pure air at the end of the compression stroke. The feature of the engine is the atomiser. Atomising is effected by forcing the fuel oil to lift its own spring-loaded needle valve that closes the opening to the injection nozzle; this is effected by a steep cam actuating the fuel pump plunger. The engine starts from cold, without the use of a lamp, with a drop usually of about 100 to 300 lb. per sq. in., stored in a receiver, with an air pressure of about 60 lb. per sq. in. The engine can utilise a large variation in grades of fuel oil. For tar oils, however, a pilot ignition is fitted, and in this case the main needle valve is tubular, the pilot oil being discharged by a needle valve inside it. The pilot oil pump is actuated by the impulse of the fuel pump plunger in the main fuel oil pump so that perfect timing is secured for the ignition jet. The consumption of the pilot oil is about 5 per cent. of the total fuel oil used at the rated working load. These engines are made up to 170 h.p. in a single cylinder.

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: N/A (Relates to design period 1914–87)
Object entry information: Diesel’s original idea was found to be impracticable, so that a modification of it was adopted. The cycle consists of four strokes, during the first of which the piston moves outwards and draws air alone into the cylinder through the inlet valve; on the second stroke the piston moves inwards and compresses this air to a pressure of about 500 lb. per sq. in. At the beginning of the third, or working stroke, the oil fuel is injected into the cylinder, through a special needle valve, by an air blast at a pressure of about 650 lb. per sq. in., and it there burns quietly at constant pressure during the short admission period and expands to the final pressure during the remainder of the stroke. On the fourth stroke the products of combustion are expelled through the exhaust valve. The temperature of the compressed air is so high that no other ignition apparatus is required and almost any kind of crude fuel oil can be completely burned, while even coal dust has been employed. The quantity of air in the cylinder is greater than that required for complete combustion of the fuel injected, in order to prevent the temperature from rising too high.

The engine shown has a single water-jacketed vertical cylinder 100 mm. (3·94 in.) diam. by 140 mm. (5·52 in.) stroke, and develops 5 h.p. when running at 600 rev. per min., on a fuel consumption of 0·53 lb. per brake h.p. per hour. The cylinder has a trunk piston and is bolted to a closed crank chamber forming the engine bed. The three working valves, and the air starting valve, are all fitted in the cylinder head, and are operated, through rocking levers and long tappet rods, by a transverse camshaft placed just above the crankshaft. The compressed air for the fuel injection and starting is supplied by an air pump placed beside the working cylinder, and having its piston driven by a crank on the main shaft. The fuel air passes directly to its valve, while that for starting is stored in steel reservoirs fixed beside the engine. The fuel is supplied to the injection valve by a small pump driven from the end of the camshaft and the quantity delivered is controlled by a centrifugal governor acting on a by-pass valve. When starting, a cam acting on the starting valve is brought into operation and compressed air is admitted to drive the engine for a few revolutions, when the valve is again put out of action.

Maker/Donor: Made in the Museum,
Date of creation: 1912.
Object entry information: This model is designed to show the operation of a petrol motor (see No. 516) working on the ""Otto"" or four-stroke cycle. A revolving pointer indicates the suction or first stroke and the points in the stroke at which the valves open and close, while another pointer moves over a power diagram such as would be obtained by an indicator attached to the cylinder. The four-stroke cycle—so called because there is one working stroke in every four strokes—is used in most of the internal combustion engines of to-day. The efficiency of the cycle depends upon the compression of the gaseous mixture before ignition, which gives a high initial pressure and a large tempera-ture range. External pumps were avoided, and the engine simplified, by making the engine single-acting and by using the cylinder alternately as a power cylinder and a pump; a heavy fly-wheel was provided to store enough energy to perform the pumping stroke. During the first outward stroke of the cycle the inlet valve opens and the piston draws in a cylinder-full of petrol vapour and air; the inlet valve then closes, and in the second or return stroke the mixture is compressed into the clearance space left at the back end of the cylinder. At the commencement of the second out-stroke the compressed charge is fired by an electric spark, the resulting high pressure driving the piston through this third stroke and storing much energy in the fly-wheel; near the end of this stroke the exhaust valve opens and remains open during the return or fourth stroke, by which the products of combustion are delivered through the exhaust pipe to the atmos-phere. The exhaust valve then closes, and a fresh cycle commences with the next out-stroke. Petrol motors are now usually governed by throttling the incoming charge, thus reducing the compression and power, but at the same time reducing the efficiency.

Object name: DIAGRAM MODEL OF PETROL MOTOR (working). (Scale 1: 2.)
Maker/Donor: Made in the Museum,
Date of creation: 1912.
Object entry information: This model is designed to show the operation of a petrol motor (see No. 516) working on the ""Otto"" or four-stroke cycle. A revolving pointer indicates the suction or first stroke and the points in the stroke at which the valves open and close, while another pointer moves over a power diagram such as would be obtained by an indicator attached to the cylinder. The four-stroke cycle—so called because there is one working stroke in every four strokes—is used in most of the internal combustion engines of to-day. The efficiency of the cycle depends upon the compression of the gaseous mixture before ignition, which gives a high initial pressure and a large tempera-ture range. External pumps were avoided, and the engine simplified, by making the engine single-acting and by using the cylinder alternately as a power cylinder and a pump; a heavy fly-wheel was provided to store enough energy to perform the pumping stroke. During the first outward stroke of the cycle the inlet valve opens and the piston draws in a cylinder-full of petrol vapour and air; the inlet valve then closes, and in the second or return stroke the mixture is compressed into the clearance space left at the back end of the cylinder. At the commencement of the second out-stroke the compressed charge is fired by an electric spark, the resulting high pressure driving the piston through this third stroke and storing much energy in the fly-wheel; near the end of this stroke the exhaust valve opens and remains open during the return or fourth stroke, by which the products of combustion are delivered through the exhaust pipe to the atmos-phere. The exhaust valve then closes, and a fresh cycle commences with the next out-stroke. Petrol motors are now usually governed by throttling the incoming charge, thus reducing the compression and power, but at the same time reducing the efficiency.

Object name: PETROL MOTOR WITH MAGNETO – ELECTRIC IGNITION (working).
Maker/Donor: Made by the Simms Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,
Date of creation: 1905.
Object entry information: This is a high-speed internal combustion engine working on the Otto four-stroke cycle (see No. 515), using petrol as fuel; it is designed for use on motor-cars and launches, or for industrial purposes. The engine has one single-acting cylinder 95 mm. (3.74 in.) diam. by 110 mm. (4.33 in.) stroke, and develops 5 h.p. when running at its normal speed of 1,000 rev. per min., but may develop 6 h.p. when accelerated. The cylinder is cast in one piece with its head, valve chamber, and water-jacket. It is mounted vertically over a closed aluminium chamber supporting the crankshaft in bearings at each end, and carrying at one side a cam shaft driven by toothed wheels, at half the speed of the crankshaft. The elongated piston is packed with three spring rings, and the connecting rod is attached by a pin passing through it. The crankshaft is balanced and carried on one end through a heavy fly-wheel whose coned interior forms one member of a friction clutch through [Text ends abruptly].

The valve chamber is divided by a horizontal partition in which are formed two seats for the inlet and exhaust valves, the port leading to the cylinder being above it. The valves are of steel and their spindles extend downward through the bottom of the chamber to meet the cam rods which operate them, springs being provided to return the valves to their seats. Below the valves the chamber is divided vertically, one side being the inlet and the other the exhaust. The valves are easily removed after taking out a screwed plug above them and a cotter in the spindle.
Petroleum spirit or petrol, a mixture of light hydro-carbons obtained by the distillation of crude petroleum and having a sp. gr. of 0.7 to 0.76, is used in preference to the heavier and cheaper oils chiefly on account of its easy vaporisation, certainty of ignition, and small residue. The explosive mixture, consisting of 1 vol. of petrol vapour and 17–20 vols. of air, is prepared in a float-feed carburetter of the Daimler-Maybach type. This consists of a chamber attached to the inlet pipe of the engine having in the centre a fine vertical nozzle; the nozzle communicates with a larger chamber containing a float which actuates, by weighted levers, a needle valve so as to keep the petrol at a constant height in the nozzle. During the suction stroke of the piston air is drawn in round the nozzle through adjustable openings and draws off the petrol, which is vaporised and mixed with it in a fairly constant proportion. The petrol enters at the bottom of the float chamber through a gauze strainer. The ignition of the mixture is performed by a low tension spark, the current being supplied by a magneto-electric machine of the form patented by Messrs. R. Bosch and F. R. Simms in 1897–98. This consists of a permanent com- pound horseshoe magnet fixed vertically on a non-magnetic bedplate and having an armature of H section fixed between its poles; one end of the armature winding is attached to an insulated terminal and the other to the core itself, thus being in metallic connection with the cylinder. In the air gap between the armature and poles an iron shield is placed, consisting of two segments, connected at the ends and provided with pivots; this is oscillated by a rod from a crankpin in the sparking cam fixed to the half-speed shaft, thus varying the magnetic flux through the armature coil and generating a current. The spark is produced by a contact breaker consisting of an insulated pin projecting into the combustion chamber and a spindle carrying an interrupter arm which is normally held in contact with the pin by a spring acting on an external lever, but is knocked off by a tappet rod raised by the cam and returned by a spring. The circuit is completed through the cylinder and casing. The time of ignition can be varied by a lever which pulls over the lower end of the tappet rod. The speed of the engine is regulated by a centrifugal governor which operates a butter- fly valve placed in the inlet pipe, so throttling the mixture and reducing the compression. When extra power is required the governor may be put out of action and the engine allowed to race.
The cylinder and valve box are cooled by a water-jacket surrounding them. Lubricant is supplied to the crank chamber to be distributed by the splashing of the crank. The engine is started by a movable winch handle engaging with a pin on the shaft, a cock on the cylinder head being opened to reduce the com- pression, which is normally 70 lb. per sq. in. The total weight of the motor is 186 lb. The petrol consumption of such motors varies from 0.8 to 1.6 pints per brake h.p. hour.","Inv. 1905-45, 29,207.

Object name: VALVELESS TWO-STROKE PETROL MOTOR.
Maker/Donor: Presented by the Day Motor Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1913.
Object entry information: This is an example of the two-stroke valveless motor patented by Mr. J. Day in 1891. It operates on the Clerk cycle (see No. 502) but has no inlet or exhaust valve, the piston itself serving as a valve when passing over three ports formed in the cylinder wall.
The engine has a single vertical cylinder 3.25 in. diam. by 3.25 in. stroke and develops 2.5 h.p. when running at 900 rev. per min., and is bolted to a cylindrical crank in one piece with its head and water-jacket, and is bolted to a cylindrical crank chamber provided with supporting wings. The ends of the crank chamber are closed by dished covers which reduce its volume, and carry long solid crank- shaft bearings which are lined with white metal and lubricated with grease so as to be airtight. The ascent of the piston causes a partial vacuum in the crank chamber, and when near the top of its stroke its lower edge uncovers a port communicating with the carburetter, and thus permits the mixture of air and petrol to rush into the crank chamber to a pressure of 3 or 4 lb. per sq. in.; the piston then com- presses the charge in the crank chamber due to the descent of its stroke and when near the bottom of its stroke its upper edge first uncovers the exhaust port

For this reason, and on account of the difficulty of getting the charge in and out of the cylinder in the short time available, this type of engine does not give double the power of a four-stroke engine of the same size, but only about 50 per cent. more at the normal speed, and even less at higher speeds. The mean effective pressure is about 60 lb. per sq. in. A specially compact form of spray carburetter, having a hand-adjusted needle jet, is attached to the crank chamber inlet port, and this is provided with a non-return valve.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Harding, Rhodes & Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1919.
Object entry information: This is a seven-figure engine revolution counter of the form patented by Messrs. T. R. and T. W. Harding in 1881. The indelible black figures are carried on seven white, porcelain-faced drums, placed side by side on a shaft extending across the casing. Behind the drums is placed the driving shaft, which projects at both ends and carries on one end an arm which is connected with some reciprocating part of the engine. This shaft carries, within the casing at the right hand end, an escapement lever which by its rocking motion rotates a three-tooth pinion; this pinion engages with teeth on the first number drum and causes it to move round through one-twentieth of a turn for each stroke of the engine, or one-tenth of a turn per revolution. Each number drum has 20 pin teeth on its right side and two teeth at one point on the left side. Above the drums is mounted a long countershaft, on which six pinions revolve loosely and project into the spaces between the drums. Each pinion has eight teeth engaging with the 20-toothed ring on its left, and at intervals with the two teeth on the adjacent drum, so that when the ten figure of the first drum comes in sight, the two teeth on that drum rotate the first pinion a quarter turn, and the pinion transmits the motion to the second drum, causing it turn through one-tenth of a revolution, and so on through the series. In order to hold the drums stationary between their movements, the alternate teeth are removed from the right-hand edge of each pinion, and two adjacent remaining teeth bear on the surface of a plain part of the rim of the drum, so that the pinion cannot turn until a notch in this plain part, corresponding with the space between the two teeth of the drum, comes opposite to the pinion. The counter is contained in a rectangular case of polished brass, the front of which can be opened only by means of a special screw key. The figures on the drums are arranged to come close up to the glass front of the case.
