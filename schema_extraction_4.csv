T. Desaguliers about 1743. A similar arrangement had been used by Hero in his steam turbine or aeolipile about A.D. 50 (see No. 35). The machine consisted of a vertical wooden frame supporting a platform at the top, on which rested the lower and stationary millstone. The upper and movable millstone was attached, passed down through the middle of the frame, and its lower end fitted in a footstep bearing, mounted on a pivoted beam extending across the bottom of the frame. A wide tube surrounded and was fixed to the shaft, and its upper end was furnished with a funnel mouth into which the water was delivered from a supply pipe. The lower end of the tube terminated in two straight, horizontal arms, closed at the ends and each provided with a small orifice, through which the water issued in tangential jets which by their reaction caused the tube and shaft to rotate. The free end of the lower bearing lever was suspended by a long bolt from a bracket on the frame, a nut on the bolt serving to adjust the upper millstone. The mill in this simple form was only made in small sizes, as it entailed a central tube equal in length to the head of water available, and the mass of water in the tube and arms was carried round as useless dead weight. This defect was overcome by M. Mathon de la Cour, who, in 1775, proposed to deliver the water directly to the arms of the mill from the upturned end of a fixed pipe, but this improvement was not put in practice until James Whitelaw used it in 1839 (see No. 21). The hydraulic efficiency of the simple Barker’s mill is about 66 per cent. and the brake efficiency 60 per cent., this being attained when the linear speed of the orifices is about equal to the velocity of the water due to its head.

This outlet is fitted with thirty guide blades which direct the water in a tangential course as it escapes. Surrounding this passage is a runner, keyed to a vertical shaft, and provided with vanes between which the water flows as it passes from the inner to the outer circumference, where it is finally discharged.

The central pipe containing the guides is carried by three screwed rods connected above by gearing, by which the pipe can be accurately raised, so as to contract the supply passage into the wheel if less than full power is required. The toe of the shaft is carried in a special bearing, supplied with oil under pressure. The power given off by the shaft is transmitted by bevel gear at the upper end.

Bamford in 1885. The piston-rod is connected directly with the bellows, and water is admitted to either end of the working cylinder by a piston valve. This valve is itself moved by the pressure water which is distributed by a small auxiliary slide valve driven from the piston-rod by a tappet-gear.
The engine has a horizontal working cylinder, with the valve chest on top. The main valve consists of four pistons, connected together and sliding in a cylindrical casing which is provided with suitable inlet and exhaust ports. The two inner pistons serve to distribute the pressure water to the end of the working cylinder, the space between them being in communication with the water inlet, while the two outer pistons are packed with cup leathers and work in the closed ends of the casing. These ends serve as cylinders, to which the pressure water is admitted alternately by the auxiliary valve, through ports in the main valve stem, so as to cause the piston valve to move from end to end. The valve stem between the two inner pistons is of rectangular section, and the necessary slide valve is applied to its upper face. Three ports are formed in this face, the outer ports leading to the ends of the main valve and the central one to the exhaust, while side lugs are formed on the auxiliary valve to keep it in place, and to serve as abutments against which the arms of a forked lever bear when moving the valve. This lever is mounted on a shaft which passes through a stuffing-box and has on its outer end a slotted lever connected with a rod which is worked backwards and forwards, through a short distance at each end of the piston stroke, by a tappet-rod fixed to an arm on the piston-rod. The tappets are adjustable so that the valve may be set to reverse the motion without shock.
When the piston nears the end of its stroke, the tappet-gear carries the auxiliary valve in the same direction, thus admitting the pressure water to the opposite end of the piston valve, and driving it in the same direction so as to admit water behind the piston to drive it back.

The cylinder of the engine oscillates on two hollow trunnions, closed at the outer ends, the hollow spaces within each trunnion being divided into two compartments, one of which on each side communicates with either end of the cylinder. Two slots cut longitudinally in the trunnion serve for ports for admission and exhaust of the water, one giving admission to each end of the cylinder, and the lower part of each bearing there are three ports, a wide one in the middle communicating with the supply pipe, and a narrower one on each side of this leading to the exhaust pipe.

53,,"1912-37, S.M. 300",Whole,N/A,,,ENGRAVING OF NEWCOMEN'S ENGINE NEAR DUDLEY CASTLE.,"This engraving, of which but few copies are known to exist, shows the steam engine erected in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen in Staffordshire, near Dudley Castle. There is evidence pointing to the belief that it was the first one constructed by him. Thomas Savery appears as joint inventor, because it was under his patent of 1698 (see No. 44) that Newcomen's engine was exploited, although it was a totally different apparatus from that of Savery. The print is the earliest known document establishing the invention of the atmospheric engine, and is of great interest as showing that, at the date of publication in 1719, automatic valve gear had been evolved; indeed there is nothing to suggest that it was not in existence in 1712. The names of Henry Beighton and Humphrey Potter have been associated with this improvement. A table of numbered references in letterpress at the sides of the print gives interesting particulars of the several parts of the plant. The principle of action of the Newcomen engine will be understood from the preceding description (No. 49). The means whereby the engine was enabled to become self-acting was a new invention of far-reaching importance. This was the valve gear which was worked by a sliding beam or plug rod attached by chains to a smaller arch-head on the beam and extended below to work a plunger pump for filling the cistern, whence injection and other water supplies were drawn. This plug rod actuated the regulator or steam valve, which was simply a sector-shaped plate, at the end of each down stroke and of each up stroke. A stirrup attached to the regulator was jerked to and fro by a Y, or forked tumbler bob, fixed to the same shaft, as were two tappets struck by pins in the plug rod. The F-shaped injection cock handle was held by a catch till tripped by a rod projecting from a buoy floating on the surface of water inside a pipe passing through the top of the boiler. A pause, whose length depended on the pressure in the boiler, would ensue with the piston at the top of the stroke. The injection cock was replaced in its catch by a pin in the plug rod. The print affords evidence that the duty of tripping the injection cock had been, at the date of the print, transferred to the ""scoggen,"" a hinged bar struck by a pin in the plug rod. The pause at the top of the stroke was suppressed so that a greater number of strokes were made in a given time; this would explain Reference 13, ""Scoggen and his Mate, who work Double to the Boy, γ is the Axis of him."" The table of references shows that the cylinder of the engine was of brass 21 in. diam., 7 ft. 10 in. long, supported above a boiler 5 ft. 6 in. diam., and 6 ft. 1 in. high, containing 13 hogsheads (700 gall.).

James Watt’s first steam engine was constructed and tried at Kinneil in Scotland in 1769, and was sent to Birmingham in 1773. At Kinneil the engine, although it had a separate condenser (see No. 62) and embodied other improvements, was hardly a success owing to its defective mechanical construction. When Watt joined Boulton the engine and boiler were conveyed from Scotland by water via Hull to Birmingham, and for two years the engine was being rebuilt and improved, until, with a new bored cast-iron cylinder, 2 ft. stroke, it worked fairly well. It was known as “Beelzebub,” and had an 18 in. cylinder, 5 ft. stroke, and worked an 18·5 in. pump against a 24 ft. head. In 1777 it was injured by fire, and “Old Bess” was constructed immediately afterwards; it was, however, of considerably more power, as the steam cylinder is 33 in. diam. with a 7 ft. stroke, and the pump has a diam. of 24 in. Its duty was to pump water from the tail-race back into the head-race of a water-wheel of 24 ft. diam. and 6 ft. breast, at times when the stream flow was insufficient. This indirect method of obtaining rotatory motion by steam power had previously been employed in London and elsewhere. Long after the introduction of the rotative steam engine, however, this method of driving was still practised for textile machinery, owing to the more regular motion that it was considered was obtainable by the intervention of a water-wheel. The power lost must, however, have been considerable, for if the mechanical efficiency of the water-wheel and its gearing was 50 per cent. and that of the pumps 80 per cent., the combined efficiency could only be 40 per cent., which would be only one-half of the mechanical efficiency of a directly rotative engine, so that twice the amount of coal then necessary would be consumed in doing the required work.",,,"[{'name': 'James Watt', 'role': 'inventor'}, {'name': 'Boulton', 'role': 'manufacturer'}]","['Soho', ""Boulton's manufactory"", 'Birmingham', 'Kinneil, Scotland', 'London']","['1777', '1769', '1773', '1894']",['cast-iron'],"['1: 12', '2 ft. stroke', '18 in. cylinder', '5 ft. stroke', '18·5 in. pump', '24 ft. head', '33 in. diam.', '7 ft. stroke', '24 in. diam.', '24 ft. diam.', '6 ft. breast']","['Shows the general arrangement of the engine erected at Boulton’s manufactory at Soho in 1777.', 'This model, which has been constructed from the data given by the existing portions of the engine, together with those on two early drawings.', 'At Kinneil the engine, although it had a separate condenser (see No. 62) and embodied other improvements, was hardly a success owing to its defective mechanical construction.', 'When Watt joined Boulton the engine and boiler were conveyed from Scotland by water via Hull to Birmingham, and for two years the engine was being rebuilt and improved, until, with a new bored cast-iron cylinder, 2 ft. stroke, it worked fairly well.', 'It was known as “Beelzebub,” and had an 18 in. cylinder, 5 ft. stroke, and worked an 18·5 in. pump against a 24 ft. head.', 'In 1777 it was injured by fire, and “Old Bess” was constructed immediately afterwards; it was, however, of considerably more power, as the steam cylinder is 33 in. diam. with a 7 ft. stroke, and the pump has a diam. of 24 in.', 'Its duty was to pump water from the tail-race back into the head-race of a water-wheel of 24 ft. diam. and 6 ft. breast, at times when the stream flow was insufficient.', 'This indirect method of obtaining rotatory motion by steam power had previously been employed in London and elsewhere.', 'Long after the introduction of the rotative steam engine, however, this method of driving was still practised for textile machinery, owing to the more regular motion that it was considered was obtainable by the intervention of a water-wheel.', 'The power lost must, however, have been considerable, for if the mechanical efficiency of the water-wheel and its gearing was 50 per cent. and that of the pumps 80 per cent., the combined efficiency could only be 40 per cent., which would be only one-half of the mechanical efficiency of a directly rotative engine, so that twice the amount of coal then necessary would be consumed in doing the required work.']",[],1894,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 1, 'terms': ['“Beelzebub”']}"

It was erected at Soho Manufactory, near Birmingham, in 1788, where it was known as the “Lap” engine because of its use for driving machinery for lapping or polishing steel ornaments. It continued at work till 1858. The framing is entirely of timber bound together by straps and bolts. The cylinder is 18.75 in. diam. by 4 ft. stroke, and Watt's parallel motion is used to transmit the movement of the piston to the beam. The latter is of timber, equal-armed, and actuates by a cast-iron connecting rod and sun and planet gearing (see No. 174), a mortice-toothed flywheel which at Soho drove two pinions 3 ft. diam. from the shafts of which motion was communicated by belts or gearing to 43 metal-working machines. The weight of the connecting rod and planet wheel is counterbalanced by a cast-iron block bolted on the opposite end of the beam. The nozzles to the cylinder were fitted in 1833 to replace the original ones. The valves are operated by tappets on a rod which serves also to work the air pump. The steam admission for one end of the cylinder and the exhaust valve for the other are released and then acted on by a weight while the corresponding valves are held closed by a detent. An early example of Watt's slow-speed centrifugal governor is driven by a chain and regulates the supply of steam by a disc throttle valve. The steam is condensed partly by a jet adjustable by hand and partly by the water in the tank surrounding the condenser. The air pump is 13.5 in. diam. by 22 in. stroke, the condensing water pump is 6.5 in. diam. by 20 in. stroke, and the feed pump is 3.5 in. diam. by 11 in. stroke.

The engine is believed to have come originally from South Lancashire. It worked at Littler's Rock Mine, Marston, Cheshire, from early in the century up to 1852. It was taken out and converted into a pumping engine, and in that state worked until 1900, when it was again altered to a winding engine and put up at the Fletcher and Rigby Mine, Marston, perhaps the oldest rock salt mine in England. Its duty, which was to lift tubs of rock salt weighing 1 ton from a depth of 330 ft., was performed intermittently until 1910, when rearrangements rendered the engine superfluous. It will be noted that timber framing has now been finally discarded; the base plate, central column, and entablature (cross-shaped in plan) are wholly of cast iron. The engine is, however, not quite self-contained, in that the ends of the base and entablature are built into the walls of the engine house. The steam cylinder is double-acting, and is secured to a rectangular cast-iron beam which is bolted to the tank containing the condensing chamber and air pump. The valves are actuated in such a manner that when the piston reaches the end of its stroke, a tappet on the air pump rod closes one set of valves, simultaneously opening the steam valve to the top of the cylinder and the exhaust to the condensing chamber. The exhaust steam is condensed by the action of a continuously operating jet of water assisted by the surrounding water. The jet was regulated by hand to maintain a constant head of water in tank. The air pump is connected to the condenser chamber by a rectangular pipe having a non-return valve between the two, a similar valve being situated inside the hot well. The capacity of the air pump is large owing to the fact that the injection was always full on, and that steam was admitted throughout the length of the stroke.

The adjacent diagram shows how the point of “cut-off” changes with the slight alteration in the governor speeds. The original Corliss valve gear was invented in 1849 by Mr. G. H. Corliss; not being an engineer he experienced exceptional difficulty in getting his invention tried, but the results obtained with it ultimately led to its very extensive adoption; the first Corliss engine in Europe was that shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1867. The leading features of the arrangement are: the employment of separate steam and exhaust valves at each end of the cylinder, so that any alteration of the point at which steam is cut off can be made without interfering with the action of the exhaust valves; the valves are cylindrical, and each is capable of being separately adjusted. The two exhaust valves, which are at the bottom of the cylinder, are rocked by a single eccentric, while the two steam-valves at the top are rocked by another eccentric. The steam eccentric swings an arm provided with a cylindrical end, upon which are two hardened steel plates; as the arm swings, these plates engage with similar plates attached to flat levers that proceed from cranks on the spindles of the two steam-valves. As the arm reciprocates, the steam-valves are alternately opened, but, at certain points, determined by the speed of the governor, the lever of the steam-valve then opening slips off the corresponding driving plate; the valve then left free is rapidly turned into a closed position by the action of a helical spring. The spring is contained in a small cylinder provided with two air “dash-pots” by which the quick closing motion is quietly arrested; this sharp and automatically adjusted cut-off is now to be found in all modern “trip” gears. The governor shown is of the high speed loaded type, and has its sensitiveness adjustable by means of a spring which is contained within the central weight; it is driven by three cotton ropes, but further to reduce the risk of the engine running away through the governor stopping, an independent gear is fitted, so that if, after the engine has been started, the speed of the governor falls below a certain limit, a trigger releases a weighted lever which automatically stops the engine through its valve gear.",,,"[{'name': 'G.

When supplied with steam at 100 lb. pressure and delivering into a surface condenser the engine indicates 300 h.p. at 240 r.p.m. The fly-wheel is 7.5 ft. effective diam. and has 10 grooves for 1.25 in. diam. rope, by which a dynamo is driven. The model deviates from the actual engine in that it does not show the second valve chest to the high-pressure cylinder, the valve of which is driven by an eccentric on the crankshaft controlled by a governor contained within a small fly-wheel. The high-pressure slide-valves are of the double ported piston type, while the low-pressure valve is of the D-slide class; all have vertical balance cylinders above them. The exhaust-valve of the high-pressure cylinder and the single valve of the low-pressure are actuated by the arrangement of valve gear shown in the low-pressure portion of the model. Both of the valve motions represented were patented in 1859 by Mr. J. W. Hackworth, of Darlington; the details of that on the high-pressure cylinder were arranged by Mr. F. C.

Rigg, will be found to resemble in its movements an oscillating cylinder engine held by its crankshaft, and performing its cycle by the revolution of the framing round the crankshaft and the cylinder round the crankpin. The varying chamber of a recipro- cating engine is thus obtained, while the inertia stresses due to the recipro- cating parts are almost eliminated. The engine has three single-acting cylinders, the long plunger pistons of which act outwardly upon three crankpins, projecting from the face of an overhanging fly-wheel. The closed end of each cylinder is formed into an eye, and fits upon a stud or trunnion fixed to the engine-bed. This stud is not on the same centre-line as the fly-wheel shaft, so that in a complete revolution each piston makes a double stroke, of a length equal to twice this eccentricity. The driving stud acts on a sliding block so that the eccentricity can be varied and the stroke of the engine is rendered adjustable. The engine is reversed by sliding the stud into line with the fly-wheel shaft and continuing the sliding so as to give the eccentricity on the opposite side. The passage of the working fluid to and from the cylinders takes place through the faces of the eyes at the cylinder ends, which are provided with ports. The fluid enters and leaves the engine by the block carrying the stationary stud, the face of the block forming a surface on which the nearest cylinder end revolves, and acting as a disc slide-valve for the three cylinders. An adjacent sectional drawing shows clearly the details of this arrangement. The engine can be worked by steam, air, or water, but the full advantage resulting from the variable stroke is only obtained when working with water, owing to the cylinder clearance increasing as the stroke is reduced.

To obtain an efficient turbine of this class it is, however, necessary that the velocity of the vanes should be nearly half that of the fluid of the impelling jet (attaining 2,000 ft. per sec.) that special arrangements are necessary to render it possible. The wheel is fixed to the middle of a long, flexible shaft, one end of which is secured within a shaft carried in bearings, while the other end is carried in a long bearing having a spherical mounting; in this way the wheel is allowed to determine its own axis of rotation in somewhat the same way as does a spinning top. The speed of the shaft is so high, however, that it is unsuited to any ordinary machinery, and is accordingly reduced in one step by helical gearing in the ratio of 10 : 1, the countershaft then running at a speed suited for the direct driving of small dynamos; for slower machinery the reduction can be further carried out by belting.
This example gave off 5·37 brake h.p. at 3,000 r.p.m. of the belt pulley, when supplied with steam at 82·5 lb. pressure, and worked non-condensing.
A trial made in 1896 of a de Laval turbine for a New York central station, with a steam pressure of 147 lb. per sq. in. and a vacuum of 25·7 in., is recorded to have shown a water consumption of 17·3 lb. per brake h.p. per hour; the total power developed was 266 brake h.p. and the turbine disc made 9,000 r.p.m. The temperature of the inlet steam was 425 deg.

This reduces the length of the machine and increases its efficiency. The blades increase in size from the high-pressure end downward and also the axial clearances, which are nowhere less than 0.125 in. The blades are made of a special bronze, drawn in strips and cut to length; they are mounted in grooves turned in the drums and in the casing, with distance pieces between them, and the whole caulked tight. The grooves in the drum are slightly undercut or serrated. The shaft, where it passes out of the casing, and also the balance drums, are kept steam tight by labyrinth stuffing boxes or packings. These consist of a series of projecting collars turned on the shaft or drum alternating with a similar series of rings fixed in the surrounding casing and almost in contact with them on one face but with a large clearance on the other; this causes alternate throttling and expansion of the steam and prevents appreciable leakage. The shaft stuffing boxes are connected so that steam and not air leaks into the vacuum end. The shaft bearings are quite outside the turbine casing and are made slightly elastic by surrounding the brasses with a series of concentric sleeves fitting easily into one another, oil being supplied by a pump. Axial adjustment is provided for by a small thrust block at the end of the shaft. The steam is admitted through a double-beat valve actuated by a piston above it; its movement is controlled by a slide valve attached to one end of a lever the fulcrum of which is caused to oscillate by means of another lever and a cam driven by a worm on the shaft; the other end of the valve lever is controlled by a solenoid or by a centrifugal governor. The effect is that the steam is admitted in a series of puffs increasing in duration with the load until the flow becomes continuous. A runaway valve is fitted which cuts off the steam should the controlling apparatus fail. In this machine there are three diameters of drum, 48 rows of moving blades, and an equal number of fixed blades varying in length from 0.5 in. to 1.75 in.

The remainder of the expansion is carried out by 20 pairs of fixed and rotating blades, of increasing length, of the ordinary Parsons form.

His is a radial flow reaction turbine, but instead of a system of fixed and moving blades, both sets of blades revolve in opposite directions and power is taken off both shafts, consequently for the same relative speed, the shafts need only revolve at half the speed of the older systems. This idea was suggested in 1879 but it was reserved for Mr. Ljungström to overcome the mechanical difficulties involved.
The turbine consists of a series of concentric blade rings, mounted on two discs, each turbine rotor being fixed to short hollow extension shafts, so that each disc is overhung from the end of its alternator shaft. The blade rings interchange, the blades being set in opposite directions; the flow of the steam is reversed in direction.
Steam of high pressure and super-heat supplied through two vertical pipes enters the blade system at the centre and expands radially outwards. Between the inner and outer pair of discs by-pass steam is admitted to the blading for overloads. On entering from the last blade ring the steam passes through a diffuser comprising a number of converging channels in which the residual steam velocity is re-converted into pressure and the vacuum at the blade edges is thus slightly increased above that maintained in the condenser. Labyrinth packing prevents the escape of steam where the shafts pass through the side discs, and also up the back of the running discs. The axial pressure of the steam tending to force the blade discs apart, is balanced by the labyrinth discs. An essential feature of the design is the use of conical expansion rings of dumb-bell section between all connected parts subjected to temperature variations, enabling them to expand and contract freely without distortion.
In this machine there are 38 rows of blade rings (see No. 229). It is fitted with a centrifugal governor which is connected to the same vertical shaft which drives the geared pump supplying oil under pressure to the bearings. In each alternator shaft is an emergency governor adjusted to come into action at a speed approximately 10 per cent. above the running speed of the turbine.
The turbines of 1,000 k.w. run at 3,000 rev. per min. with a steam pressure of 162 lb. per sq. in. and a superheat of 310 deg. F. The steam consumption is 11.55 lb. per k.w. hour, or 8 lb. per brake h.p. hour. An efficiency of 73.6 per cent. is claimed.

Monroe in 1875. Its features are that it permits of free lateral and angular motion of the rod due to vibration, it is self-adjusting under wear, and its contact round the rod is chiefly derived from the steam pressure.
In the arrangement shown by the sectional specimen the packing is of the duplex type, consisting of two separate sets of packing, the inner series partially resisting the steam pressure and the outer one completing the work.
The inner packing consists of three babbitt metal rings contained in a conical cup fitted with a gland which is forced home by springs assisted by the steam pressure. The front of the cup is free to slide on the plane face of a washer, the other face of which beds in a spherical recess on another washer, while the gland end is free to slide on the plane face of another washer which is forced home by a number of helical springs, but the chief closing pressure upon the gland is that exerted by the steam. With the exception of the soft metal rings the whole of these parts are bored much larger than the piston rod diameter.
The outer packing is similarly held endwise between flat and spherical faces kept in contact by springs assisted by the steam pressure, and so arranged as to give freedom for lateral and angular movement of the rod and its packing. The packing itself is, however, quite different, consisting of two rings each made up of gunmetal blocks and two blocks of babbitt metal, all forced inward by radial springs. The soft metal sectors break joint and also press upon the rod, while the gunmetal ones are quite clear of the rod; the reduced steam, moreover, which has passed the inner packing exerts a radial pressure upon these blocks which keeps them in closer contact with each other, and also presses the soft metal blocks upon the rod. Each babbitt metal block embraces one-third of the circumference of the rod, and as the four blocks break joint the complete circumference is thus fully covered.
It is claimed that, owing to the closing of the packing being automatically performed by the steam pressure, the arrangement works for many years without attention, and that wear is diminished owing to the pressure being relieved during the exhaust strokes.

Parsons patented the present form of blade and the method of fixing them in plain or serrated grooves cut in the drum and casing. The blades are made of drawn brass and have indentations formed across their lower ends; they are cut to length and inserted in the grooves with correctly shaped distance pieces between them, which are then expanded by caulking tools so as to grip the blades and the sides of the grooves. One or more notches are cut in the edge of each long blade, and lacing strips are soldered into them so as to increase the rigidity of the blades.

In this way radial clearance may be reduced to a minimum without danger of stripping.
In order to assemble the turbines more rapidly, the blades, instead of being put in singly, are now made up into segments, consisting of a number of blades fastened together, and these are afterwards caulked into the grooves.

The apparatus consists of a rectangular sheet iron chamber, at one end of which is fitted a fan driven by an electric motor.

Brown in 1905, particular attention has been paid to the following points: unimpeded upward circulation of air, continuous subdivision of the descending stream of water, and spreading of the water as a film over a large surface. This is achieved by the use of wooden arris rails nailed to short battens in groups of three to constitute a hurdle; copper is used for all fastenings.

The water is distributed by a cross-launder to a net-work of troughs over which it flows on to the hurdles. Notches in the rails check the tendency of the water to form into streams, and cause instead trickling from one hurdle to the next one below. Steam passes off at the top of the tower, and water, cooled to several degrees below that of the surrounding atmosphere, collects in the reservoir below (see lower part of case).

Mollerin in 1881. It is employed extensively on the Continent, and a modified form is manufactured in this country.
It consists of a lower vessel to contain oil, fitted with a hollow plunger or piston, which is actuated by an arrangement of ratchet, worm and screw gearing. The upper end of the piston forms a nut for a square-threaded screw which has a worm driven by a ratchet wheel, the latter obtaining its motion by its attachment to a reciprocating part of the engine. Thus at every stroke of the engine a slight turn is imparted to the square-threaded screw, and this, being fixed in position, causes the nut, i.e., the piston, to descend and force out oil into the distributing pipe, which is attached to the upper part of the oil cylinder. The rate of oil feed can be adjusted to suit the requirements by moving a sliding block on the ratchet arm. When a wing nut above the plunger screw is tightened, the worm wheel and the screw rotate as one, but when this nut is loose, the worm wheel and the plunger can be raised or lowered by turning the handle at the top of the lubricator.
To fill the lubricator, the wing nut is slackened and the plunger is drawn to the top of its stroke. Oil can then be poured into the lower vessel through the cup at the side.
The rotation of the plunger is prevented by a piece of bent wire, U-shaped at its upper end, which is guided by a vertical fixed wire rod. The screw is only just long enough to allow the plunger to reach its lowest position and empty the vessel of oil; any further rotation then winds the screw out of the plunger.",,,"[{'name': 'A. M.

The valve spindle has fixed upon it an external weight (or a spring), which is balanced by the normal pressure of the liquid within the pipe. On any failure of the pressure the valve turns automatically and moves a lever, which brings into operation electrical or mechanical alarm gear. The spindle of the valve is provided with anti-friction glands of special design to allow of rotation without leakage. It also resets itself when normal running is attained. It should be observed that it is not the static pressure of the water, but its momentum, which keeps the valve open. There are two types of these valves, one for an open-ended pipe, which is the most usual arrangement, and the other for a closed circulation system under pressure, as represented by the example here shown. The alarm gear is of several kinds; in this case it is a whistle, which is the device suitable for steam-driven pumps or for air-compressors. The connection to the whistle is from the pump steam chest or from the compressor intercooler and thus, while automatic, only functions when the plant is actually working. The general arrangement for an air-compressor is shown by a diagram. In other cases such as a gas engine having forced circulation of cooling water, the Monitor valve may close an electrical circuit so as to ring a bell, or to actuate a plunger, e.g., to cut the magneto out of circuit.

This type of boiler, which together with its setting was only an adaptation of existing practice with brewers’ pans and spirit stills, was used throughout the 18th century for supplying steam to atmospheric engines; under the name of the “balloon” boiler it survived in the Staffordshire district till late in the 19th century. The period represented by the model is about the middle of that century. At first it was the practice to place the boiler vertically under the engine cylinder, but about 1760, as the power of engines was increasing, the demand for more steam was met by an increase in the number of the boilers, placed in contiguous settings, rather than in their size. The boiler was under-fired and set in masonry or brickwork, so that the hot gases made a complete circuit of the sides on their way to the chimney in a way known as a “wheel draught.” As the pressure used was practically only that of the atmosphere, the question of construction was subsidiary to that of heating surface; accordingly we find that the flange boiler, which was the type used with the earliest Newcomen engines, had the side flue formed by a horizontal flange uniting vertical sides to a base plate. Later a slight improvement was made by adopting conical or concave sides, hence the name “haystack.” The bottom was at one time recessed so as to form a spiral flue, as patented in 1748 by Thomas Stephens and Moses Hadley, but generally it was flat or concave. Internal stays were but rarely used, and instances of boilers up to 15 ft. diam. without them are recorded. The numerous explosions that had been traced to these defects in shape and construction and the low ratio of heating surface to cubic contents possible, led to the disuse of this type of boiler. The material of which the boiler was made was at first copper, often with lead for the top; the corners appear to have been made by flanging the plates. On account of their durability and less cost, wrought-iron plates produced by hammering seem to have been substituted as early as 1725. Cast iron was also used; even in 1776 Smeaton preferred this material for his boilers. It was not till about 1790 that plates and other sections produced by rolling became generally available. The feed water was introduced through a valve controlled by hand into a cistern on a vertical stand-pipe by which a column of water of sufficient height to balance the pressure within was obtained. The water level was indicated by the position of a lever connected with a float inside. The blow-off pipe was usually stopped simply by a wooden plug. The model represents a boiler 11 ft. high by 12 ft. diam. at the dome, decreasing to 10 ft. diam. at the bottom.

The type was developed about 1820 from a somewhat similar construction patented and introduced in 1803 by Arthur Woolf. It was used in this country at one time as a mill boiler, but was superseded by the Lancashire boiler. The highest development has been reached on the Continent, especially in France, hence one of the names by which it is known here. It remains still an accepted type on the Continent, but is now being displaced by the water-tube boiler.
The step grate for burning fuel of low calorific value was introduced in Germany about the middle of the 19th century. It consists of a succession of flat bars, stepped one in front of the other terminating in a fixed flat grate, the fuel being introduced by a hopper at the top.
The model shows a boiler installation made by A. Leinweber & Co., of Gleiwitz, for a pressure of 7.20 lb. The steam drum is 1.4 m. (4.6 ft.) diam. and 11 m. (36.1 ft.) long, its thickness being 11 mm. (0.43 in.) except over the fire, where it is 15 mm. (0.59 in.) thick. The two water drums are 750 mm. (2.46 ft.) diam. by 9.1 m. (29.9 ft.) long, their thickness being 7 mm. (0.27 in.). They are supported on cast-iron stools at a slope of 1 in 32 to the blow-off cock. The heating surface is 70 sq. m. (752 sq. ft.).
The grate is formed of flat plates resting in ledges on side and intermediate bearers, leaving air spaces of about 1 in. measured vertically. The angle of the grate is 35 deg.; these proportions are for wood chips and sawdust, which is the fuel used. The flat grate is of the usual construction and is cleaned through a door in the side wall. The total grate surface is 3.27 sq. m. (35 sq. ft.), i.e., in the ratio of 1 : 21.4 of the heating surface.

It consists of a large number of communicating globular iron chambers, cast in sets of four ; the ends of each set are machined so that tight joints can be made when several sets are held together by internal tie-rods. In this way the cells are connected into slabs, while by suitable castings and tie-rods a number of these slabs are similarly united to form a complete boiler of the requisite heating surface. The slabs are arranged with a slope of 25 deg. in a brickwork chamber, the furnace being at the lower end and the steam pipe at the top, while suitable bridges distribute the gases between the nests of cells. About one-third of the cell capacity is used as steam space, and in it a certain degree of drying or superheating is effected. Exceptional portability and adaptability were claimed for the arrangement, as well as great safety, owing to the smallness of the individual elements of which the generator is built up. The boiler has since been somewhat modified, and as now constructed is given a slope of 40 deg. with the horizontal. On trial it was found that one of these generators, when tested to 875 lb. steam pressure, leaked considerably at the joints, but that it became tight again upon the pressure dropping to 450 lb.

Field in 1862. The application of the internal circulating tube to the inclined tubes of boilers of the water-tube type was first achieved by M. Collet, who also introduced the double-chambered header, but the attachment of the outer tubes he, however, employed long internal bolts, and these proved to be unsatisfactory. The practical success of the arrangement is, therefore, due to the work of M. M. Niclausse, who invented and patented, between 1891 and 1900, a form of joint for this purpose which has overcome the difficulties and led to the successful introduction of this system of construction (see also Marine Engineering Collection).
The model shows, partly in section, a Niclausse boiler having a brick setting. The boiler consists of groups of slightly inclined tubes, closed at the back ends and connected at the front in double vertical rows of headers, which themselves open at the top into a collecting drum or chamber—each double row with its an outer portion of its header, which also communicates with the collecting drum, so that water from the drum may pass down the headers and through the central passage between the two tubes and up the steam generated, return through the passage between the two tubes and up the steam generated, return through the headers again into the drum, without the two streams mixing or interfering. The water level is above the bottom of the drum, and a dividing plate separates the hotter water from the cooler portion, including the feed water. There is, however, no lower water chamber, so that this form of boiler cannot be completely emptied without removing the tubes.
The method of attaching the tubes to the headers consists in the employment of a special sleeve or “lantern,” passing through the header and fitting it by means of coned surfaces, while the smaller end is screwed to receive the outer tube. The lantern of the inner tube screws into the outer lantern, and dogs outside the headers keep the conical surfaces in contact, little retaining pressure being, however, required owing to the areas nearly balancing. An attached drawing shows this tube joint in detail, and also a later form of grate of greater simplicity.
The boiler represented has a grate area of 45.7 sq. ft., and 1,420 sq. ft. of heating surface; it would supply about 8,800 lb. of steam per hour at a pressure of 256 lb. per sq. in., which, in a suitable engine, would give about 440 h.p.

The mud-drum is made of cast metal, or of wrought mild steel, and is connected to the rear headers by short expanded tubes. STOKER. Firing is done by hand on a fixed grate or by an automatic stoker. The one shown is of the chain grate type embodying several improvements made by the firm. The travelling chains are formed of links supported on rollers and actuated by sprockets from an eccentric and ratchet from an eccentric on an overhead shaft. The sprockets are adjustable in channels so that it can be drawn back bodily from the furnace front. It is carried on the grate. The hopper is independent, being secured to the furnace front. It is fitted with a sliding door to regulate the depth of fuel carried on the grate. There is a flap which can be hooked back when it is desired to stoke by hand. At the far end of the grate is an ash plate with renewable nose, and beyond it a dumping door worked by worm and quadrant. The entire boiler is suspended, so that it can expand or contract without any strain being thrown on the surrounding brickwork, by wrought iron slings from rolled joints resting on iron columns. Two fire-brick baffles arranged among the tubes cause the hot gases from the furnace, under the influence of the chimney draught, to take a sinuous course which, together with the arrangement of the tubes, ensures a large amount of direct impact by the gases. The damper is placed in the rear wall, and the doors for cleaning the tubes and removing the soot are in the side walls, while the front is rendered accessible by two iron doors. The boiler is fitted with the usual mountings, comprising main steam stop-valve, safety-valve, feed-valve, blow-off valve, water gauges, and steam pressure gauge. The boiler represented contains about 900 sq. ft. of heating surface, which would be capable of evaporating from 3,000 to 3,500 lb. of water per hour ; such boilers can be constructed for any pressure not exceeding 500 lb. per sq. in. ; about 200 lb. is, however, the most usual. SUPERHEATER. The model shows also the Babcock and Wilcox steam superheater as arranged in such a boiler, to heat the steam generated beyond the boiler temperature, and so reduce the subsequent losses in the steam engine. This superheater is placed in the space between the drum and the inclined tubes and consists of 4 groups of 6 solid drawn steel tubes 1.5 in. diam. bent into U form, arranged horizontally, and expanded at their ends into two wrought steel boxes or “manifolds,” provided opposite the tubes with inspection handholes. The steam from the boiler drum passes down from a collecting pipe into the upper manifold, then through the superheater tubes into the lower manifold, from each end of which it passes by pipes leading to the stop-valve. To prevent injury to the superheater tubes when steam is being raised from a cold boiler, an arrangement is provided for flooding them with water. This consists of a connection with the water space of the boiler drum and two cocks, by opening the larger of which the water is admitted to the superheater but any steam formed rises directly to the boiler drum. When steam has been got up, before opening the boiler to the steam main, the large cock is closed and the small one is opened so that the water in the superheater drains away, a gauge glass being provided to show that the draining is completed.

The thermal storage system employed by Mr. Halpin, while depending upon the same principles as these earlier arrangements, forms a somewhat different application. In the method he patented in 1891–2, which was primarily designed to overcome the difficulties experienced in electric light stations through the great variations in the work required from the plant at various times, the excess of heat received by the boilers when the engine demand for steam is slight is stored in a reservoir of hot water, suitably lagged with non-conducting covering. The reservoir is a vertical cylindrical vessel 30 ft. high by 8 ft. diam., greater capacity when necessary being secured by increasing the number of such vessels. The boiler and reservoir pressures are higher than that at which the steam is supplied to the engine, and the thermal storage is represented by the difference in the amount of heat in the reservoir at the temperatures corresponding with the higher and lower pressures respectively. With pressures of 250 lb. and 115 lb. absolute it is estimated that each pound of water originally in the reservoir will supply 0.07 lb. of steam at the lower pressure, which steam is thus available to assist the boilers at the time when the engine demand exceeds their supplying capacity; furthermore, water from the reservoir can be directly admitted to the boiler so that the feed can at the same time be shut off. When, however, through steam having been withdrawn, the temperature and pressure of the reservoir have fallen, the mass of cooler water it contains is capable of condensing steam from the boiler and thereby storing heat when, through a reduction in the demand, the boilers are supplying more steam than is being required. These lithographs, however, show a modification of the apparatus patented by Mr. Halpin in 1901, in which a storage reservoir or drum is placed on the top of a horizontal boiler and connected with its shell by a tube of large area which extends nearly to the top of the drum, both vessels being at the same pressure. The feed water, from an injector or pump, is introduced at the top of the drum wherein, as it becomes heated nearly to the steam pressure, it deposits its sediment thus saving incrustation in the boiler itself. This hot water, taken from above the sediment level, is afterwards allowed to flow into the boiler as feed when an exceptional load comes on, the injector feed being shut off so as to increase the steaming power.

The destructive energy of a boiler depends upon the pressure and the amount of water in it, but the damage done by the explosion is largely influenced by the rapidity of the dissipation of the energy as determined by the area of the rent, so that if this is sufficiently restricted the result may be nothing more serious than a leakage of steam or water.",,,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 0, 'terms': []}"

The top surface of this travelling grate is maintained level by a series of transverse carrying rollers, and the sag of the lower return portion is restricted in the same way, while the wear of the links can be taken up by adjusting screws which move the bearings of the inner sprocket wheels.

In this sprinkler stoker, which was originally patented by Mr. Proctor in 1875, and has since been considerably simplified and improved, the feeding is performed by a flap, which jerks the fuel on to the grate in a way resembling hand-firing with a shovel, the further distribution of the charge being accomplished by the use of reciprocating fire bars. The model shows the stoker fitted to the front of a Lancashire boiler, and feeding from a single coal hopper above, from which the fuel is distributed by a block, reciprocated horizontally along a pipe, to a small chamber at the front of each furnace. In each of these chambers is a flap which is moved away from the furnace by pegs on a revolving crank plate and then rapidly swung forward by the action of a spring, thus throwing and distributing the fuel on to the grate in small quantities. The fire bars are arranged in pairs alternately fixed and moving, the latter receiving a slow combined vertical and horizontal movement from a crank pin on a shaft driven by worm gearing.

The boiler steam enters the space between the two valves, and rushes to the reduced pressure pipe beyond; some, however, passes through a vertical communicating orifice to the under side of the diaphragm, which is thereby thrust upward and carrying the valve with it reduces the supply of steam, and consequently lowers the pressure below the diaphragm.

Above the valve box, but cast with it, is a circular dish separated by a flexible metallic diaphragm from a similar dish above it which is open to the atmosphere, while the spindle of the valve extends upward and is attached to a cap in the centre of this diaphragm. Above the top dish are two horizontal tie-rods, connected by crossheads, which control two helical springs under compression, and these, by short vertical levers, press upon a pair of toggle plates, which thereby exert a downward thrust upon the diaphragm and valve spindle. The boiler steam enters the space between the two valves, and rushes to the reduced pressure pipe beyond; some, however, passes through a vertical communicating orifice to the under side of the diaphragm, which is thereby thrust upward and carrying the valve with it reduces the supply of steam, and consequently lowers the pressure below the diaphragm. In this way the valve finds and maintains a position in which the pressure of the reduced steam on the diaphragm balances the effort exerted by the external helical springs. By the introduction of the toggle plates the rise in the reduced pressure, which would result from the increased compression of the springs when the valve is fully opened, is prevented by the alteration that at the same time takes place in the angle of the toggle joint.",,1903,"{'count': 0, 'terms': []}","{'count': 0, 'terms': []}"

A subsidiary advantage is that more duty can be obtained from the boiler with it than without it, and troubles from expansion and contraction are minimised. The apparatus is built into the main flue between the boiler and the chimney. In the particular case shown in the model the boiler is of the Lancashire type and the apparatus is arranged in a by-pass flue with suitable valves, so that the boiler may be worked with or without it. The economiser shown embodies improvements patented by Mr. A. Lowcock and Mr. T. Sykes between 1880 and 1894. It is constructed of vertical cast-iron pipes whose ends are forced by hydraulic pressure into top and bottom headers; the top headers are provided with a lid or cleaning cover, while the bottom ones have a slope towards the blow-off branch pipe, to which is attached a blow-off valve. Each tube is fitted with scrapers, which are moved slowly up and down to remove the soot which would otherwise accumulate and would seriously detract from the efficiency of the apparatus. The scrapers are worked in balanced groups by chains passing over pulleys actuated by worm gear, the reversals at the end of their travel being effected by a tappet-moved, three bevel wheel clutch, and assisted by a rolling weight. The soot scraped off falls into a chamber below the pipes and is removed at intervals through cleaning doors. The feed-water is forced into the economiser by the feed-pump or injector through the bottom branch pipe at the end furthest from the boiler and leaves by the top branch nearest the boiler, so that the hottest gas meets the hottest water. The economiser is made in sections of from 4 to 12 pipes in width and of any length to suit the number and capacity of the boilers installed. Each tube has over 10 sq. ft. of heating surface. The feed-water is usually supplied to the economiser at 32 deg. C. (90 deg. F.) and leaves at 120 deg. C. (250 deg. F.) to 150 deg. C. (300 deg. F.), a saving of fuel of as much as 20 per cent. is claimed.

471,1921-259,,Whole,N/A,,donated,DRAWING OF ONE-MOVEMENT RE-STARTING INJECTOR,"The original injector, in which only one handle was used for starting the injector and regulating the water and steam supply, was patented by Mr. R. G. Brooke in 1890. The example shown is of this type, but embodies several improvements, and, although not compound, can work with comparatively hot feed water.
The control handle is fixed to a spindle, which is free to revolve but is incapable of longitudinal motion within the body of the injector. Near the lower end of the spindle is a quick-threaded screw and at its extremity is a cone valve. The steam nozzle has a sleeve on its nut engaging with the thread on this spindle, and the nozzle and nut are free to slide longitudinally, but not revolve, within the injector casing, a gland being used to prevent steam leakage. The combining cone is fixed and divided near the centre of its length by the main overflow gap. The outlet from the overflow chamber is regulated by an automatic valve. There is also an overflow gap between the combining and delivery cones.
The injector body is made in two parts and can easily be taken down, while provision is made for the lubrication of the chief working parts.
When the starting handle is in the closed position the steam nozzle is screwed up to its highest point so that the cone valve on the spindle closes the entrance to the steam nozzle. As the handle is turned the steam nozzle is forced downwards away from the cone valve and nearer to the combining cone. The effect of this movement is at first gradually to open the steam inlet, while the water has practically free access to the combining cone, and later, while the steam passage remains fully open, the lower end of the steam nozzle approaches so close to the combining cone as to reduce the water inlet area, and thus the water supply can be reduced to about one-half of the full delivery.
The injector is restarting and can be used for lifting. With no lift and steam at 160 lb. per sq. in. it can take feed-water at 115° F. (46° C.), or at 135° F.

472,,1921-431,Whole,N/A,,,EXHAUST STEAM INJECTOR,"This is a sectioned example of an injector patented in 1908 by Messrs. J. J. C. and R. D. Metcalfe. Owing to the use of two exhaust steam nozzles in series it can deliver against a pressure of 120 lb. per sq. in., instead of only about 75 lb. per sq. in. as in the single jet type (see 455). The exhaust steam from the engine passes into the ejector through a hand-controlled wing valve, after which part of it passes through the central exhaust steam nozzle and part through the annular nozzle surrounding the draft tube. The combining nozzle is of the flap type, arranged to give a very free outlet, and an automatic hinged valve is fitted to the overflow chamber. When the wing valve is opened steam passes into the injector. When the water, which must be under a slight head, is turned on it passes through the injector to the overflow mixing with the exhaust steam and condensing it, thus causing a partial vacuum which draws in more steam. In this way in a short time the velocity of the steam through the two nozzles is sufficient to give the necessary momentum to the water. The condensation of steam and the giving up of its momentum takes place in two stages, thus increasing efficiency and enabling the delivery pressure to reach as high a value as 120 lb. per sq. in. In other respects the injector works like the usual automatic live steam injector. The water supply is regulated by moving the central exhaust nozzle, which can slide longitudinally within the injector body towards the draft tube, thus reducing the annular area through which the water has to pass. This movement is performed by means of an eccentric pin fitting in a slot on the outside of the nozzle and worked by the external water regulator handle. For working the injector when the engine is not running a live steam connection is provided.

This is accomplished by using a horizontal iron pipe carrying at its end a hand-wheel and a stop valve, and having within it a copper pipe which carries the seat of the valve at one end but is rigidly fixed only at the opposite extremity. The valve is slightly withdrawn from its seat so as to let the water escape, but when all the water is exhausted and steam enters the copper pipe the greater expansion of copper (about 50 per cent. more than iron) elongates the internal tube sufficiently to close the valve.

It consists of a tube of brass, or other metal with a high coefficient of expansion, connected at one end with a valve casing, the other end being secured to a flange attached to the steam piping which it is required to drain. Two iron rods are mounted with their inner ends carried in a collar pivoted on the end flange, and with their outer ends carried, one against the valve casing and the other against the shorter arm of a spring-loaded lever. The lever operating against the steam pressure bears against the discharge valve spindle and keeps the valve closed.
When the trap is cold, it is arranged that the valve is open owing to the pressure of the upper iron rod on the shorter arm of the bellcrank lever. Steam then passes freely through the trap, raising the temperature of the brass tube, which, expanding, relieves the pressure of the iron rod on the lever, and allows the spring to shut the valve. Condensed water then collects in the brass tube, and, as its temperature falls, the tube contracts, thus opening the valve, when the same series of operations recurs.

It consists of a long cylinder, formed of a closed steel heater at one end, which is surrounded by a furnace, and at the other end of a larger cylinder, enclosed in a water-jacket, by which this end is kept cool. The cold end is fitted with an air-tight piston, which, through two connecting-rods and a weigh-shaft, is coupled to a crank on the fly-wheel shaft. To another crankpin on the second weigh-shaft is coupled, and this is connected with a rod passing through a gland in the piston, and attached to the “displacer.” This displacer is a loosely fitting plunger, which is supported by a roller in the cylinder, and its office is to push the air from the hot end of the cylinder to the cold end and back again, as required. The only valve is a small one, fixed to the cylinder and opening inward, so that any air lost by leakage is replaced whenever the internal pressure falls below that of the atmosphere.

The same air is worked continuously, being alternately heated and cooled during each revolution of the crankshaft. At the commencement of the outward stroke of the piston the displacer is at the cool end of the cylinder, and the bulk of the air, which is accordingly at the hot end, is being heated, so increasing in pressure and driving the piston outward. This movement rotates the crankshaft, and so moves the displacer towards the hot end, thus causing the hot air to pass to the cool end of the cylinder, where the pressure falls through the reduction of temperature due to the cold water-jacket, and the return stroke of the piston then takes place, under the action of the fly-wheel. The work given off is the difference between that done by the air during the outward stroke of the piston and that done upon it during the inward stroke.

It was patented in 1855 by John Ericsson, who had worked on the subject since 1825, had patented his first engine in 1833, and in 1852 had built some very large engines for ship propulsion with cylinders 14 ft. diam. The engine shown was made about 1869, and remained in use 30 years.

A cast-iron furnace chamber with grate bars and removable linings projects inside a prolongation of the working cylinder. The products of combustion pass through a lagged jacket surrounding the furnace part of the cylinder before passing away to the flue.

In the cylinder move an outer leather-packed working piston and an inner displacer piston both connected with the crankshaft by link work which causes them to move in different phases to one another, and gives them different lengths of stroke. In the inward stroke cold air is drawn in, through weighted non-return valves in the working piston, into the space between it and the displacer, the exhaust valve being lifted meanwhile by a cam. When the displacer has completed 0·9 of its stroke, but the working piston 0·4 of its stroke, the air is compressed between the pistons and in the space round the furnace. To ensure the air being thoroughly heated a sheet iron prolongation of the displacer works into the annular space between the chamber and a baffle cylinder, the compression and heating of the air causes the return or working stroke, the piston undergoing the same phases as before, but in the reverse direction, till at the end of their strokes they are close together, and the air between them has been transferred through an annular non-return valve in the displacer, to the space round the furnace. The speed of the engine is controlled by a centrifugal governor, opening a waste valve. To stop the engine the exhaust valve can be opened by hand.

The plungers work within two cylindrical chambers, one chamber being kept cool by a water-jacket, and the other being heated from below by a furnace, which, in the model, is replaced by a gas burner. The two chambers are in free communication by a connecting box, which, however, is filled with a number of thin cast-iron plates, so that a large expanse of metal surface is presented to any air passing through the box, which is the regenerator. The stroke of the hot plunger is considerably longer than that of the cold one, so that although the pressures under the plungers are always equal, the volume displaced by the hot plunger is the greater. A constant weight of air is enclosed between the two plungers, but as the crankshaft revolves this arrangement of the cranks is such that during the upward stroke of the hot plunger more of the air is in the hot chamber, and consequently the common pressure is higher than when the plungers are returning. The difference between the power exerted in the upward strokes and that absorbed by the return strokes gives the useful work. In passing through the regenerator the air from the hot chamber leaves some of its heat, which it absorbs again on its return passage, the same air being passed backward and forward continuously, and its pressure rising and falling with each revolution. To replace any loss through leakage a small air valve opening inward is fitted, and through this air enters if at any portion of the cycle the internal pressure falls below that of the atmosphere.

The working cylinder, 4.5 in. diam. by 2.75 in. stroke, is placed horizontally, while the displacer cylinder, 6.5 in. diam. by 1.87 in. stroke, is placed vertically in front of and below it. The upper end of the displacer cylinder is made of cast iron, and is kept cool by a water-jacket. The lower part is of thin sheet brass, and projects into the furnace chamber, where it is heated by a gas flame. A port connects the working cylinder with the displacer cylinder. The working piston drives a crank on a horizontal shaft, and this crank is connected by a link to a horizontal lever above it, the other end of which is pivoted to a lug on top of the cylinder. A slotted link, hanging from an intermediate point in the lever, embraces the connecting rod and is connected with the displacer rod below. The displacer itself is a hollow piston with perforated ends, fitting loosely in its cylinder, and filled with fine tangled wire which acts as a regenerator for economising heat. Its motion, due to the link connections, is about 90 deg. in advance of that of the working piston, so that when the latter is at the back end of its cylinder and commencing to move outward the displacer is at mid-stroke and rising. The air is then passing from the cool upper part to the hot lower chamber, where it is heated and, expanding, exerts a pressure on the working piston driving it outwards. The air also takes up some heat from the wire in the displacer through which it passes. This action continues while the displacer rises to the top and the working piston reaches mid stroke. The displacer then begins to descend and the hot air below is transferred to the cool end, leaving some of its heat in the wire. By the time the working piston has reached the outer end of its stroke the air has contracted, the consequent fall in pressure causing the piston to return.
The speed is controlled by a governor valve fitted to the circular air inlet of the working cylinder; this consists of a tin cone, which is drawn forward so as to partially close the inlet when the velocity increases beyond the normal. The valve is fixed to a spindle passing through the cylinder cover, and is normally held open by a light, adjustable spring.

The working chamber is a water-jacketed horizontal cylinder, with a crescent-shaped block or abutment secured to it on one side. Concentric with the cylinder is a fly-wheel shaft, carrying within the chamber a cylindrical drum, the diameter of which is such that the drum touches the abutment. Through the drum is a longitudinal diametral slot, fitted with two blades or pistons, which, by an intervening spring, mutually press outwards, but the shape of the abutment was intended to give a constant diameter, while the spring secured an elastic contact. As the shaft revolves, this diametral piston is forced to and fro by the interior surface of the chamber, and with the abutment divides the volume into three portions of continually varying dimensions. By the revolution of the piston, gas and air are drawn into the chamber through a port at the bottom of the cylinder, and a little later an external flame explodes the mixture, generating a pressure which, acting on the unbalanced area of one blade, causes the fly-wheel shaft to revolve. After thus doing work, the products of combustion escape through an outlet at the top of the chamber. There are two explosions per revolution, but, in common with all engines of its time, there is no compression of the charge before ignition. The admission of gas and air to the cylinder is controlled by a semi-rotary plug valve, which also shuts off the intermittent igniting flame, the latter being re-lit after the explosion by a permanent light at the side. This valve is driven by a cam on the fly-wheel shaft; the exhaust outlet has no valve, but is shut off periodically by the revolving piston.

The piston is single-acting, and in its first out-stroke draws in gas and air through two drop valves worked by a lever from a cam on a shaft running at half the speed of the crankshaft. In the return stroke these mixed gases are compressed into the clearance space at the end of the cylinder, and at the commencement of the second out-stroke are fired by a red hot tube with which they are then placed in communication. During this “explosion” stroke the piston is being forced outwards under a high but rapidly diminishing pressure, the energy thus transmitted to the crankshaft being chiefly absorbed by the fly-wheel which subsequently delivers it as driving power during the two revolutions which are included in the cycle. The speed of the engine is regulated by an inertia governor which completely cuts off the supply of gas when the normal speed is exceeded, so that there is no explosion, and the subsequent two strokes are performed entirely by the energy in the fly-wheel. This governor is in the form of a spring-controlled weight, hinged to the gas admission lever, and so arranged that if the admission lever is flicked by the cam with more than the normal velocity a tappet attached to the weighted portion fails to engage with the gas admission valve. The cylinder is enclosed by a jacket through which water is circulated, in order to prevent the working parts from reaching a temperature that would rapidly destroy them; this at present necessary cooling, however, carries off about 30 to 40 per cent. of the available energy generated by the combustion of gas.",,,"[{'name': 'G.

520,MODEL OF SUCTION GAS PLANT.,1911-115,Whole,N/A,,loaned,MODEL OF SUCTION GAS PLANT.,"Scale about 1:8. Lent by the National Gas Engine Co., Ltd., 1910. The idea of working a gas producer, used in conjunction with a gas engine for power purposes, by means of suction induced by the engine itself, instead of by steam pressure, is due to Mons. Leon Benier, of Paris, who designed the first plant of this kind in 1894. It follows that the production of gas is automatic and that the pressure in the plant is below that of the atmosphere, so that danger from gas leakage is absent. Benier provided the engine with a separate pump for suction, but it is now found that, if the generator be not too far from the engine, the suction stroke of the latter is all that is necessary. A suction gas plant costs less, is simpler to work and requires less labour than a pressure plant, but suction is of less calorific power than pressure gas.
The plant consists essentially of a generator and a scrubber. The former part has a hopper to feed in the non-bituminous fuel, i.e., charcoal, anthracite or coke, which is used; below this is a fuel-container, whence the fuel falls into a firebrick lined producer provided with a grate and closed ashpit. Around the fuel-container is an annular space, through which the hot gases pass. Bounding this annular space is a ribbed cast-iron vaporiser, of the form patented in 1906 by Messrs. H. N. Bickerton and P. W. Robson. Water is caused to trickle over the exterior of the vaporiser to form steam; thus it works on the flash principle and the steam can be easily regulated—an important factor in working. The vaporiser can easily be scaled, as the surrounding shell is removable. The sensible heat of the outgoing gases is further used in warming the incoming air and feed-water; the former mixes with the steam in the vaporiser and they pass together into the ashpit. The gas then passes by a pipe with a water seal to a scrubber filled with coke over which a stream of water from a sprinkler pipe and distributing dish is continually trickling. The clean and cool gas finally passes to the engine. When starting the plant, a centrifugal fan, worked by hand, is used for blowing the producer, and the gases generated are allowed to pass with the air by opening the cock on the open vertical pipe.
In tests of suction gas plants made at Derby in 1906 for the Royal Agricultural Society, a 20 brake h.p. “National” plant showed a consumption per brake h.p. per hour of 1·04 lb. anthracite coal and 1·14 gal. of water. For its design and performance it received the highest award—a gold medal.
These plants are made in sizes up to 300 h.p.",,,"[{'name': 'Leon Benier', 'role': 'designer'}, {'name': 'National Gas Engine Co., Ltd.', 'role': 'lender'}, {'name': 'H. N.

The sensible heat of the outgoing gases is further used in warming the incoming air and feed-water; the former mixes with the steam in the vaporiser and they pass together into the ashpit. The gas then passes by a pipe with a water seal to a scrubber filled with coke over which a stream of water from a sprinkler pipe and distributing dish is continually trickling. The clean and cool gas finally passes to the engine. When starting the plant, a centrifugal fan, worked by hand, is used for blowing the producer, and the gases generated are allowed to pass with the air by opening the cock on the open vertical pipe. In tests of suction gas plants made at Derby in 1906 for the Royal Agricultural Society, a 20 brake h.p. “National” plant showed a consumption per brake h.p. per hour of 1·04 lb. anthracite coal and 1·14 gal. of water. For its design and performance it received the highest award—a gold medal.

In it the fuel oil is sprayed into pure air at the end of the compression stroke and is automatically ignited by a vaporiser or hot bulb extension to the cylinder end. An external lamp is required when starting, but this can be dispensed with when running, as the bulb is then kept hot by the explosions. The same cycle was afterwards adopted in the Diesel engine, except that the latter employed a much higher compression which raised the temperature of the air high enough to ignite the fuel without external or other heating. The so-called semi-diesel engine, however, works precisely on this Akroyd cycle.
The cylinder is horizontal, 9⋅25 in. diam. by 16 in. stroke, the liner fitting within a jacket casing which is cast in one with the bed plate and crank shaft bearings. The hot bulb is bolted to the cylinder end, there being a narrow neck at the junction. On the suction stroke air alone enters through a spring-loaded automatic valve at the end of the bulb, and is compressed on the succeeding stroke. The fuel oil is lifted from a tank in the bed by a pump driven by spur gearing and a cam at half the speed of the crank shaft; it is delivered to a nozzle in the hot bulb where a finger in front of the nozzle serves to spray the fuel. Fins are cast across the upper part of the hot bulb to facilitate the ignition. The exhaust valve is placed below the cylinder and is operated by a lever and cam. Speed regulation is effected by a centrifugal governor which acts on a valve in the suction pipe of the oil pump.
An alternative form of hot bulb with a water or oil jacketed throat, patented by Mr. Stuart in 1892, is also shown.

Diesel’s original idea was found to be impracticable, so that a modification of it was adopted. The cycle consists of four strokes, during the first of which the piston moves outwards and draws air alone into the cylinder through the inlet valve; on the second stroke the piston moves inwards and compresses this air to a pressure of about 500 lb. per sq. in. At the beginning of the third, or working stroke, the oil fuel is injected into the cylinder, through a special needle valve, by an air blast at a pressure of about 650 lb. per sq. in., and it there burns quietly at constant pressure during the short admission period and expands to the final pressure during the remainder of the stroke. On the fourth stroke the products of combustion are expelled through the exhaust valve. The temperature of the compressed air is so high that no other ignition apparatus is required and almost any kind of crude fuel oil can be completely burned, while even coal dust has been employed. The quantity of air in the cylinder is greater than that required for complete combustion of the fuel injected, in order to prevent the temperature from rising too high.

The engine shown has a single water-jacketed vertical cylinder 100 mm. (3·94 in.) diam. by 140 mm. (5·52 in.) stroke, and develops 5 h.p. when running at 600 rev. per min., on a fuel consumption of 0·53 lb. per brake h.p. per hour. The cylinder has a trunk piston and is bolted to a closed crank chamber forming the engine bed. The three working valves, and the air starting valve, are all fitted in the cylinder head, and are operated, through rocking levers and long tappet rods, by a transverse camshaft placed just above the crankshaft. The compressed air for the fuel injection and starting is supplied by an air pump placed beside the working cylinder, and having its piston driven by a crank on the main shaft. The fuel air passes directly to its valve, while that for starting is stored in steel reservoirs fixed beside the engine. The fuel is supplied to the injection valve by a small pump driven from the end of the camshaft and the quantity delivered is controlled by a centrifugal governor acting on a by-pass valve. When starting, a cam acting on the starting valve is brought into operation and compressed air is admitted to drive the engine for a few revolutions, when the valve is again put out of action.

The thermal efficiency of the Diesel engine is rather higher than that of the explosion gas engine, and has reached 40 per cent., but the mechanical efficiency being lower reduces the brake thermal efficiency to a maximum of about 32 per cent., which is comparable with that of the gas engine. The mean effective pressure in the cylinder is from 110 to 120 lb. per sq. in., and a fuel consumption, at full load, of slightly over 0·4 lb. of oil per b.h.p. hour has been attained.",,,"[{'name': 'Diesel', 'role': 'inventor'}]",,1914–87,oil fuel;air;coal dust;steel,100 mm.

This model is designed to show the operation of a petrol motor (see No. 516) working on the ""Otto"" or four-stroke cycle. A revolving pointer indicates the suction or first stroke and the points in the stroke at which the valves open and close, while another pointer moves over a power diagram such as would be obtained by an indicator attached to the cylinder. The four-stroke cycle—so called because there is one working stroke in every four strokes—is used in most of the internal combustion engines of to-day. The efficiency of the cycle depends upon the compression of the gaseous mixture before ignition, which gives a high initial pressure and a large tempera-ture range. External pumps were avoided, and the engine simplified, by making the engine single-acting and by using the cylinder alternately as a power cylinder and a pump; a heavy fly-wheel was provided to store enough energy to perform the pumping stroke. During the first outward stroke of the cycle the inlet valve opens and the piston draws in a cylinder-full of petrol vapour and air; the inlet valve then closes, and in the second or return stroke the mixture is compressed into the clearance space left at the back end of the cylinder. At the commencement of the second out-stroke the compressed charge is fired by an electric spark, the resulting high pressure driving the piston through this third stroke and storing much energy in the fly-wheel; near the end of this stroke the exhaust valve opens and remains open during the return or fourth stroke, by which the products of combustion are delivered through the exhaust pipe to the atmos-phere.

The valve chamber is divided by a horizontal partition in which are formed two seats for the inlet and exhaust valves, the port leading to the cylinder being above it. The valves are of steel and their spindles extend downward through the bottom of the chamber to meet the cam rods which operate them, springs being provided to return the valves to their seats. Below the valves the chamber is divided vertically, one side being the inlet and the other the exhaust. The valves are easily removed after taking out a screwed plug above them and a cotter in the spindle.
Petroleum spirit or petrol, a mixture of light hydro-carbons obtained by the distillation of crude petroleum and having a sp. gr. of 0.7 to 0.76, is used in preference to the heavier and cheaper oils chiefly on account of its easy vaporisation, certainty of ignition, and small residue. The explosive mixture, consisting of 1 vol. of petrol vapour and 17–20 vols. of air, is prepared in a float-feed carburetter of the Daimler-Maybach type. This consists of a chamber attached to the inlet pipe of the engine having in the centre a fine vertical nozzle; the nozzle communicates with a larger chamber containing a float which actuates, by weighted levers, a needle valve so as to keep the petrol at a constant height in the nozzle. During the suction stroke of the piston air is drawn in round the nozzle through adjustable openings and draws off the petrol, which is vaporised and mixed with it in a fairly constant proportion. The petrol enters at the bottom of the float chamber through a gauze strainer. The ignition of the mixture is performed by a low tension spark, the current being supplied by a magneto-electric machine of the form patented by Messrs. R. Bosch and F. R. Simms in 1897–98. This consists of a permanent com- pound horseshoe magnet fixed vertically on a non-magnetic bedplate and having an armature of H section fixed between its poles; one end of the armature winding is attached to an insulated terminal and the other to the core itself, thus being in metallic connection with the cylinder. In the air gap between the armature and poles an iron shield is placed, consisting of two segments, connected at the ends and provided with pivots; this is oscillated by a rod from a crankpin in the sparking cam fixed to the half-speed shaft, thus varying the magnetic flux through the armature coil and generating a current. The spark is produced by a contact breaker consisting of an insulated pin projecting into the combustion chamber and a spindle carrying an interrupter arm which is normally held in contact with the pin by a spring acting on an external lever, but is knocked off by a tappet rod raised by the cam and returned by a spring. The circuit is completed through the cylinder and casing. The time of ignition can be varied by a lever which pulls over the lower end of the tappet rod. The speed of the engine is regulated by a centrifugal governor which operates a butter- fly valve placed in the inlet pipe, so throttling the mixture and reducing the compression. When extra power is required the governor may be put out of action and the engine allowed to race.
The cylinder and valve box are cooled by a water-jacket surrounding them. Lubricant is supplied to the crank chamber to be distributed by the splashing of the crank. The engine is started by a movable winch handle engaging with a pin on the shaft, a cock on the cylinder head being opened to reduce the com- pression, which is normally 70 lb. per sq. in.

This shaft carries, within the casing at the right hand end, an escapement lever which by its rocking motion rotates a three-tooth pinion; this pinion engages with teeth on the first number drum and causes it to move round through one-twentieth of a turn for each stroke of the engine, or one-tenth of a turn per revolution. Each number drum has 20 pin teeth on its right side and two teeth at one point on the left side. Above the drums is mounted a long countershaft, on which six pinions revolve loosely and project into the spaces between the drums. Each pinion has eight teeth engaging with the 20-toothed ring on its left, and at intervals with the two teeth on the adjacent drum, so that when the ten figure of the first drum comes in sight, the two teeth on that drum rotate the first pinion a quarter turn, and the pinion transmits the motion to the second drum, causing it turn through one-tenth of a revolution, and so on through the series. In order to hold the drums stationary between their movements, the alternate teeth are removed from the right-hand edge of each pinion, and two adjacent remaining teeth bear on the surface of a plain part of the rim of the drum, so that the pinion cannot turn until a notch in this plain part, corresponding with the space between the two teeth of the drum, comes opposite to the pinion. The counter is contained in a rectangular case of polished brass, the front of which can be opened only by means of a special screw key. The figures on the drums are arranged to come close up to the glass front of the case.",,,"[{'name': 'Harding, Rhodes & Co., Ltd.', 'role': 'presented by'}, {'name': 'T. R. and T. W.

T. R. & T. W. Harding in 1881 (see Nos. 307 and 307a). The driving spindle of the counter passes right through the casing, and may be driven from either end. The drive is taken by means of a rubber-faced bit which fits on the end of the counter spindle and is held in contact with the end of the revolving shaft of which the speed is to be measured; the time is taken by a watch while the counter is in action. A solid pointed and a hollow rubber-lined bit are provided. The working parts of the instrument are made of hardened steel, and it may be used with accuracy at speeds over 5,000 rev. per. min.",,,"[{'name': 'Harding, Rhodes & Co., Ltd.', 'role': 'presented by'}, {'name': 'T.
