The embedded type of mark is more suitable in country districts, where no ground-rock or permanent stone building is available. The ""standard"" type of bench mark was first employed in 1904. It consists of a stone monolith of 2 ft. square section, 3 ft. high, set upon a foundation of concrete 6½ ft. square by 2 ft. deep. The top of the monolith is cut in the form of a frustrum of a pyramid, and terminates in a square of 3 in. side, the central point of which constitutes the mark. The date of construction of the monolith is engraved on it, together with the inscription ""G.T.S. Standard Bench Mark,"" whilst the height of its reference point above sea-level at Karachi is engraved upon a stone slab embedded in a brickwork setting round the base of the monolith.

This suggested to him the construction of a heliotrope, of which the sextant-heliotrope, made in 1829, was the first type. The telescope is mounted on a circle capable of rotation about a horizontal axis, and can itself revolve about the centre of the circle. This circle has no divisions and is only for giving a slow motion to the telescope by means of a screw. Through a sleeve on the telescope passes a brass rod carrying a mirror perpendicular to it; the distances of the mirror and the sleeve from the axis of rotation of the telescope being equal.

The sudden jerk caused by the stoppage of the downward motion of the wearer’s body at each step is sufficient to make the pendulum oscillate. A spring pawl, fixed at one end to the pendulum arm, engages at its other end the teeth of the ratchet wheel. A counter spring pawl, pivoted in the bed of the instrument, opposes the thrust of the former with a force sufficient to damp the rotary movement of the ratchet. The teeth of the ratchet are very fine, so that as the pendulum moves from the upper stop to the lower, the pawl passes over several teeth, the number depending upon the adjustment of the lower stop, which is threaded in a fixed block. By this adjustment, the indication of the recording pinion can be varied to correspond roughly to the length of the observer's stride. The ratchet wheel is geared to a train of pinion wheels which record the distance travelled in miles and furlongs. There is only one dial and pointer, the former graduated in miles up to twelve, with eight sub-divisions to each mile.

The device of Colby consists in so connecting two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, that two reference marks on metal tongues attached to them remain at an invariable distance apart whatever the temperature. Two bases have been measured with this apparatus, one in the North of Ireland in 1827-28, and the other on Salisbury Plain in 1849. Ten bases have been measured with similar apparatus in India. In this apparatus two bars, one of brass and the other of iron, each 10 ft. 1.5 in. long, 0.3 in. broad and 1.5 in. deep at a certain temperature, are placed in a deal box, and firmly connected at their centres by two small transverse steel cylinders, nearly in contact. Near each extremity of the double-bar is a metal tongue, 6.2 in. long, which is connected to each bar by pivots so as to permit expansion, but no other movement of the bars. On a silver plug at the extremity of each tongue is engraved a dot—the compensation point. Since the lengths of the tongue between the dot and either bar is proportional to the coefficient of expansion of that bar, no joint expansion of the bars due to temperature changes will affect the position of the dot. Consequently the dots are 10 ft. apart at all temperatures. The compound bar is placed in a deal box, and is kept from moving lengthwise by a brass stay fixed firmly to the bottom of the box at the centre and projecting upwards between the two small steel cylinders connecting the bars. A long steel cross-wise level is fixed to the top of the brass bar and read through a glass covered opening in the top of the box. The tongues carrying the compensation points project beyond the box, but are carefully protected. In measuring, the boxes are supported at their quarter and three-quarter points on stands which permit lateral and longitudinal motion. The dots on two adjacent bars are brought to the precise distance of 6 in. apart by means of a compensation microscope. This latter is formed by uniting two microscopes by parallel bars of iron and brass in such a manner that the distance between their outer foci remains exactly 6 in., whatever the temperature. The whole apparatus consists of six bars and seven microscopes, of which two bars and three microscopes are exhibited.

In Jäderin’s system, the massive rigid base-bars hitherto employed were replaced by light metallic wires or tapes freely suspended under a constant tension. The saving in labour and time thus effected easily outweighs the slight loss in accuracy sustained. Independent measurements of each section of the base are made with two wires of different metallic structure, and the effect of temperature variations is thus calculated. The apparatus exhibited comprises two tripods and two pairs of wires, 25 and 50 metres long respectively, each pair consisting of one brass and one steel wire. The tripods are provided with steel observing pins mounted upon double ball and socket joints, which permit slight displacements of the pins when the tripods are fixed. The wires are nickel-plated, and are provided at each end with decimetre scales, graduated in millimetres. The centimetre divisions of these scales are numbered from 5 to 15, and the length of the wire between the “10” division at each end is the characteristic length. The wires terminate beyond the scales in loops, to which are attached the flexible cords carrying the straining weights. The tension may be applied by hand, and measured by a spring balance, or by attaching weights to the cords. The cord at each end passes over a pulley or trestle, which serves to take the end strain and to adjust the scale of the wire during the actual measurement into close proximity to the side of the observing pin.

Gautier, a French artillery officer, about 1865, and has been extensively used in the French army. Its main feature is a thin prism mounted in a ring at the object end of the sighting tube. By rotating the ring the deviation of rays in the plane of the distant object and the horizontal through the instrument can be varied continuously, and the ring calibrated correspondingly. The sighting tube is about 5 in. long by 1·5 in. diam. and has a protecting tube which can be fitted underneath to serve as a hand-grip when observations are being made. The sighting tube, in addition to the movable ring containing the prism, has a pair of plane mirrors having their faces inclined to each other at an angle of about 45°, and so inclined to the optical axis that rays incident through a window in the side of the tube in a direction nearly perpendicular to the axis, are doubly reflected at the mirrors into the line of the axis, and pass through a small telescope at the eye end of the tube. In the instrument shown, two such telescopes of different powers are fixed side by side. One of the mirrors can be slightly rotated so as to vary the angle of deviation of the reflected rays. In using the instrument, the observer sets the range scale on the movable ring at “infinity” and the index of the movable mirror at the centre. He views the distant object by double reflection at the mirrors and looks directly through the tube and prism for a convenient aiming mark. If such a mark is not quite co-incident with the image of the distant object, he rotates the mirror until coincidence occurs. Then the object and the aiming mark are in directions nearly perpendicular to each other. Next he paces out a convenient distance in the direction of the aiming mark and takes a second observation similar to the first, but this time effects the coincidence by means of the movable prism. He reads off the scale calibrated on that ring when coincidence is effected and multiplies the distance of his base. The result is the range of the distant object. The movable ring is really calibrated to record the reciprocal of the angle of deviation caused by the prism, which is the same as the reciprocal of the angle subtended. by the base at the object. As this base has been made nearly perpendicular to the direction of the object, the product of its length and the reciprocal of the angle gives the range. Thus any convenient base length can be used subject to the condition that it subtends an angle of not more than 3° at the distant object. (See “ Notice sur le Télémètre de Poche,” by A.

Each system forms a “broken” telescope, the objectives being at each end of the tube, along which the rays, originally perpendicular to it, are deflected by right-angled prisms to the centre, where they are again reflected at right angles into the common central eye-piece. In this manner two images of a distant object whose direction is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the tube are obtained, one through each system. These images will be separated laterally by an interval which diminishes continuously as the range increases, but does not become zero until the object is at an infinite distance. If the objective lens and two prisms of one system are separately mounted and can be rotated with respect to the other system, the two images may be made to coincide by such a rotation, and the angle of rotation necessary will vary inversely as the range of the object. This angle can be obtained by calculation, or a table of corresponding values. In the instrument exhibited such an arrangement is effected by mounting one object lens and its pair of reflecting prisms in a separate tube within the main tube containing the other set, and pivoted to this so that the rotation can be effected by a screw threaded in the outer tube with its end pressing against the inner. The angle of rotation is measured by a vernier on one tube and a scale nearest second of arc, and the range read off on a table fixed to the outer leather protecting cover.",,,"[{'name': 'P.

It consists of a small telescope and spirit-level separately mounted upon a platform connected with a tripod by means of a ball-and-socket joint of a special type, often employed in small surveying instruments of German construction. This joint permits the orientation of the platform to be varied, whilst leaving it perfectly free to rotate in azimuth about the socket, which is fixed to the tripod. The platform terminates underneath in a metal ball, at the lower end of which is a cylindrical pin. The socket consists of two parts screwed together, an upper spherical dome enclosing the ball, and a lower tubular sheath surrounding the pin. Two levelling screws, set perpendicularly to each other, work in threads in this sheath, and impinge upon a metal collar which encircles the pin sufficiently tightly to prevent shake, but not to hinder the free azimuthal rotation of the pin, and consequently the platform. Opposite the two screws, and likewise impinging on the collar is a spring which takes the pressure of the screws. By means of these screws the platform can be set level in all directions. The spirit level can be adjusted upon the platform by the small screws at one end of its case, whilst the telescope can be elevated or depressed about an axis at one end fixed in the platform by means of a fine-threaded screw at the other end.

102,BREITHAUPT'S COMPENSATION LEVEL.,1876-1198,Whole,N/A,,,COMPENSATION LEVEL,"Made by F. W. Breithaupt and Son, Cassel. 1859 This is a later modification of a level designed and constructed by F. W. Breithaupt in 1845, with the idea of minimizing the instrumental adjustments usually necessary as a preliminary to taking levels. The method of weighting the main spirit level and suspending it freely in pin bearings attached to the telescope enables the surveyor to compensate by double readings the errors arising from non-parallelism of the spirit-level axis, telescope axis, and line of sight. In this level the telescope can be rotated in its collars through a complete half-turn, the extreme positions being determined by mechanical stops. The spirit level, whilst revolving with the telescope, does not rotate, but is kept with its engraved scale uppermost. Consequently the bubble is always visible against the scale, and its variation during the rotation measures the extent to which the axis of the spirit level is inclined to the axis of rotation of the telescope. Such an inclination, if small, will be automatically rendered ineffective provided two readings of the levelling staff are made with the spirit level “centred,” one before the telescope is rotated in its collars through 180°, and the other after. This double reading also corrects for lack of coincidence between the mechanical axis of rotation of the telescope and the line of sight. The mean of the two readings will be the true reading which would be obtained if the three axes of spirit level, telescope rings and vision were mutually parallel. Thus it is not necessary to adjust the instrument beforehand for this parallelism. It is, however, essential that the spirit level itself should be so adjusted that when its bubble is central, its own axis of rotation reversing the spirit level in its bearings should be horizontal. This can be tested by centring the bubble, and reading the bubble again. Half the difference is removed by the means of the two capstan-headed screws which fix one end of the bubble tube to its case. To enable the spirit level to be so reversed, one bearing pin can be withdrawn from its supporting bracket. The lower part of the instrument is provided with a circular box level, which serves to set the main axis nearly vertical by means of the footscrews. No attempt is made to render this axis exactly vertical, as the telescope is always finally levelled by means of the elevating screw. The head of this latter is divided, and serves to measure very accurately small gradients. The diaphragm of the telescope has two horizontal subtense wires in addition to the central levelling wires, so that the instrument can be used to measure distances.

The advantages of a metal scale for levelling staves have until recently been counterbalanced by the tendency of such scales to expand when heated, and the difficulty of ascertaining their temperature in order to apply the necessary correction. The invention of “invar”—a nickel-steel alloy of negligible temperature coefficient—has now led to its employment in levelling rods used in precise surveys. The example shown is the lower portion of such a rod. The invar rule is painted white and engraved with black bands at intervals of 0.02 ft., every fifth band extending over the complete width (about 2 cm.) of the rule, and the others over half its width. The rule is then screwed into a central recess in the face of the wooden rod, which has an I section for strength and lightness, and is shod with a metal shoe terminating in a flat base plate; the bottom of the invar rule is flush with this plate. The face of the wooden rod is painted white and numbered opposite the marks corresponding to intervals of 0.1 ft. on the invar rule. The numbers are in black, and are inverted so as to be seen erect in the telescope of the level; a V is used instead of 5 and an N instead of 9. At the divisions of the rule corresponding to an integral number of feet from the base plate, large red numbers are painted on the wood, and are twice repeated in smaller sized numbers on the opposite side of the face so that the observer has always one of the red numbers in the telescope field. In estimating the position of the cross wire with respect to the graduated scale of the rod, the nearest 0.02-ft. mark is taken and the remaining interval found either by elevating or depressing the telescope by a fine-motion screw, or by moving an optical device which causes the image of the rod to be raised or lowered in the telescope field.

Made in the Museum During excavations in the Via Abbonanza at Pompeii, in 1912, under the direction of Cav. M. Della Corte, fragments of a Roman groma were discovered. These fragments were sufficiently preserved and complete to enable Dr. Della Corte to reconstruct the original instrument with a certainty not hitherto attained owing to the meagre data available. The instrument exhibited has been constructed in accordance with the measurements and drawings supplied by Dr. Della Corte. As previously reconstructed, the groma consisted of a cross, composed of two equal perpendicular arms intersecting at their centres, mounted upon a supporting staff (ferramentum), upon which the cross could revolve in azimuth: from the ends of the cross were suspended four plummets, through which sights were taken by the surveyor. This reconstruction comprises all the foregoing portions, with the additional modification that the cross is not supported directly upon the staff, but is pivoted upon the outer end of a curved bracket, which is in turn mounted rotatably upon the head of the staff. This arrangement enables the centre of the cross to be set above the mark on a boundary stone, whilst the staff is driven into the ground beside the stone; also, sights could be taken through opposite, not adjacent, plumb lines without interference from the staff. The wooden staff, which is nearly 2 metres long, terminates at its lower end in a fluted iron shoe, and is encircled at its upper extremity by a brass collar, along its upper and lower faces by curved brass strips, and terminating at the staff end in a brass collar and at the cross end in a brass pivot upon which the curved bracket is mounted. The horizontal distance between the cross and bracket pivot centres is 23.4 cm. The cross has a brass centre, and four tapered wooden arms, completely enclosed in thin iron sheeting and reinforced at their intersection by brass angle brackets. The bronze plummets are suspended through holes in the arms at distances of 45 cm. from the centre of the cross. Each plummet resembles its opposite in size and shape but differs from the neighbouring ones. The actual portions discovered included all the metal parts, with a few traces of wood fibres embedded therein. The total height of the instrument is alone considered problematical. (See M.

Similar outfits have been extensively employed by the topographers of the U.S. Geological Survey. The table is 30 in. by 24 in., and is carefully made in sections to preserve its shape. Brass screw pins fitting into sockets at the corners and middle of the sides are used for fastening the drawing paper to the table, which is slightly recessed at these points to allow the heads of the pins to be flush with the upper surface of the board and thus permit the alidade to slide freely over the pins. The board is connected to the tripod by means of a Johnson quick-levelling socket, which permits it to be easily levelled and rotated in azimuth independently of the tripod. Two butterfly nuts control these movements of levelling and rotation, and, when tightened, clamp the table rigidly to the tripod. This latter has three split legs, 4 ft. long, attached by bolts to the metal tripod head and terminating in metal shoes. Any point on the sketch can be set vertically above the corresponding station point, after the instrument is levelled, by means of the wooden plumbing arm which consists of two pieces so jointed and marked at the joint that, when the upper piece is set flat on the table, with its point over the point on the sketch, and the joint clamped with its two marks coincident, the metal hook at the end of the second arm lies vertically beneath the point.

This example has a $4rac{1}{2}$-in. horizontal circle, graduated in degrees and read by three symmetrically placed verniers to 6'. The vertical arc, reading angles up to 70° of elevation or depression, has a radius of 2 in. and is similarly graduated and read by a single vernier centrally placed on the horizontal vernier plate. Both circles have toothed edges, in which engage pinion wheels, the motion of rotation being effected by turning these pinions. The telescope is attached above the vertical arc by screw bearings which permit it to be adjusted to sight horizontally when the vertical arc reads zero. A small spirit level fixed above the telescope, and a smaller one rigidly joined to the vertical arc enable this adjustment to be effected. The horizontal axis of rotation of the vertical arc and telescope rests on standards projecting from the central plate carrying the three horizontal vernier arms.

A movable brass index arm, provided with folding sights, is centred on one of the sighted sides of the rectangle and rotates over a brass scale mounted on the other side. This scale is graduated to read tangents, to the nearest tenth. A clamp and screw fixed to the index arm serve to clamp it in any desired position to a brass arc fixed to the rectangle. The outer sight on the arm carries a plumb-line when the rectangle is horizontal.

In each case, the circles are completely enclosed in metal, dust-proof cases, and the microscopes are consequently provided with mirror reflecting tubes for illuminating the graduations. The first microscope is a ""Schätz"" or ""Estimation"" Microscope, and has a single fixed line marked in its focal plane, parallel to the graduations of the circle. It is used in theodolites having 10-cm. circles, graduated every 10'. The position of the fixed microscope line between these graduations is estimated to a single minute. (See ""Zeitschrift für Vermessungswesen,"" 1902, p. 214-216.) The second microscope, known as a ""Nonien-Mikroskop,"" has a fixed vernier scale marked in its focal plane, and is used for theodolites having 13-cm. circles graduated to 5'. Ten divisions of the vernier scale correspond to nine of the circle, whence the position of the zero vernier line can be read to 30"", or even to 15"" by estimation. Alternate graduations of the vernier scale are numbered consecutively from 0 to 5, and represent minutes. (See ""Zeitschrift für Instrumentenkunde,"" 1912, Part V.)

The method of reading a graduated scale by means of a micrometer microscope having at its focal plane a movable cross wire, was first applied to theodolites by Ramsden in the construction of his 3-ft. instruments. The diagram shows the details of his later microscopes, which were added to the original two of his theodolites, and which differ very slightly from those. The microscope has a single objective lens fixed in a tube, which is mounted in the supporting bracket and can be slightly adjusted towards or from the graduated circle of the theodolite. The base of the micrometer box is screwed to the top of this tube and has a smaller one screwed into its top; the latter carries a slide-focussing eyepiece of the usual Ramsden type. The micrometer box contains two adjustable stages having their inner surfaces contiguous and their outer surfaces touching the walls of the box. The lower edge of the aperture of the upper stage has divisions notched in it at intervals of a hundredth of an inch, every fifth notch larger than the rest. The interval between the larger scale divisions is the same as that between adjacent divisions on the graduated circle when the latter interval is magnified by the microscope objective. Thus the interval between consecutive notches is 1′ of arc on the circle. The lower stage has a cross hair attached to its inner face, and can be moved as a whole across the notched scale by rotating the micrometer head; this head is threaded on to a screwed pin fixed to one end of the stage, and is pressed against the micrometer box by a counter helical spring inside the box. The pin has 100 threads per inch, so that the cross hair moves over one division of the notched scale at each revolution of the micrometer head. The periphery of the drum on this head is divided into 60 parts, and its rotation read by the position of a knife edge fixed to the box. Thus a rotation of the drum through one division of its periphery causes the cross hair to travel through 1″ of arc on the circle. The stage carrying the notched scale can be adjusted in the box by means of a screw and counter V-spring acting on its ends until the cross hair lies over a notch when the micrometer drum reads zero.

It acts on the principle of determining the exact moment at which a known star crosses a horizontal circle of constant angle, namely 60°. The instrument exhibited is the ""geodetic"" model of the firm, and has a telescope of aperture 40 mm. and magnification 75 diam. Latitudes can be determined with it to 0.4"" and time to 0.04/sin $\lambda$ sec., where $\lambda$ is the co-latitude of the observing station. The telescope can rotate in azimuth upon one end of a horizontal plate, which carries a mercury artificial horizon at its other end and can itself rotate above the graduated horizontal circle of the instrument. This circle is divided in degrees, serving any particular star. An equilateral glass prism of sides and height 45 mm. is mounted in front of the objective lens of the telescope, with its base vertical and apex edge horizontal. When the star is nearly at an altitude of 60°, two images are seen of it in the telescope, one by light refracted through the prism and telescope, and the other by light reflected from the mercury horizon before refraction in the prism. At the precise moment that the star crosses the 60° horizontal circle, the two images meet on the same horizontal line of the telescope graticule.

The ordinary magnetic needle is not sufficiently sensitive to respond to the daily changes in the magnetic meridian, and the instrument exhibited was designed by Mr. T. Lindsay Galloway to enable the meridian to be fixed with the required accuracy. The instrument consists of a tribrach levelling stage, supporting a long cylindrical case within which is suspended an arrangement consisting of a plane mirror and a pendant connected by a fibre of unspun silk. Both mirror and pendant are mounted upon stems to which the ends of the fibre are fixed, and a small bar magnet is attached across the back of the mirror. Either the pendant stem or the mirror stem, or both together, can be clamped to the case by means of adjustable stirrup clamps, and the case can be inverted upon the tribrach levelling stage so that either the pendant or the mirror is uppermost. In using the instrument the case is first set up with the mirror above and the pendant below, and the latter is then unclamped and allowed to turn freely until it comes to rest, when it is clamped up again. By this means any twist is taken out of the fibre. The case is next inverted so that the mirror is below the pendant, whereupon it oscillates between two stops. If necessary, the case is rotated in azimuth to enable the mirror to come to rest with its plane in the magnetic meridian.

This circular plate can rotate within a hollow central axis which terminates below in a spherical ball; this ball forms part of a ball and socket joint connecting the instrument to a stand.

When the horizon and water line images are made to coincide by revolving the index arm, the reading of the index on the graduated arc gives the range of the distant object directly. The index mirror is not mounted upon the pivot of the rotating arm, but upon an eccentric pivot, connected to the arm by a cam and pin mechanism, which causes the mirror to rotate through a much smaller angle than the arm; this enables the angle swept out by the reflected ray to be varied very gradually between narrow limits, whilst the index traverses an arc of 60° or thereabouts. As the angle of depression of the distant object below the horizon varies inversely as the range, if the base—i.e. the height of the observer above sea level—is constant, the arc of the sextant can be graduated to read the range directly.

It can automatically plot contours, lines of rivers, roads, fences, etc. It also allows the optical axis of the camera used in obtaining the two stereo- photographs to be plotted.",,,"[{'name': 'E. von Orel', 'role': 'designer'}, {'name': 'Carl Zeiss, Ltd.', 'role': 'lender'}, {'name': 'Zeiss', 'role': 'constructor'}]",['Military Geographical Institute'],"['1908', '1909', '1911']",,,"The stereo-autograph is a device designed for plotting points from a stereo-photographic survey.
