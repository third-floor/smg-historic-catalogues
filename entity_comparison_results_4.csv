Steam was then again admitted, and by its pressure forced the water in the receiver out through the delivery valve and pipe, the suction pipe in the meantime being closed by its non-return valve.

The engine is contained within a tank supported on four feet. A dividing partition enables the cylinder and valve box to be packed with non-conducting material, while the air-pump and condenser are surrounded by water. The cylinder crosshead has two side rods working on to a pin on the end of a beam rocking on a centre on the underside of the tank. The other end of the beam has a connecting rod to a crankshaft above, with a large fly-wheel. The air-pump is worked similarly by side rods from an intermediate point in the beam. Neither cylinder nor air-pump crossheads are guided. Steam is distributed to the cylinder by the \u201clocomotive\u201d slide-valve which had been patented by Murray in 1802. The valve has a rack on the back geared into by a sector which is actuated by a rod having a frame at the other end embracing a cam on the crankshaft; the cam gives a period of rest at the end of each stroke.

When a fluid pressure was applied the pipe slightly straightened, and by fitting the free end with a pointer, found that reliable readings of the pressure were thus obtainable. This action depends on the fact that the product of the curvatures of a surface in planes at right angles is constant, so that if one radius of curvature is diminished, as by the elliptical section becoming more nearly circular, the other radius increases. The gauge consists of a thin curved tube of elliptical section, with one end fixed in a block to which the admission pipe is attached, while the other end is free; this end is closed and connected by multiplying gear with the index. In one of the forms shown, a link from the end of the tube is connected with a short extension of the index finger, which is pivoted near the edge of the dial.

The model embodies improvements patented by Mr. H. Messer in 1863-4, and has the hot cylinder and the furnace arranged in a rectangular base with the space between them filled with non-conducting material. The furnace itself is a firebrick chamber with a perforated bottom, closed above by a removable charging door. Air from the atmosphere is, by the cold cylinder, pumped into the casing of the furnace, where it is heated, while some of it maintains the combustion of the fuel. The heated air and gases then pass to the hot cylinder, where, on account of their greater volume, they perform much more work than was absorbed in working the air pump, the difference being the available power for overcoming the friction of the engine and doing external work. The cylinders are both single-acting, and are connected with opposite cranks on a shaft above. The admission and exhaust valves of the hot cylinder are of the drop type, and are controlled by cams operated by an eccentric on the crankshaft.""], ""other"": [""(Scale 1: 8.)"", ""(Engine designed by Sir G.
