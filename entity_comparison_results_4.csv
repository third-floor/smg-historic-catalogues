The blower shown has a cylinder 5.5 in. diam. by 10 in. stroke, and is fitted with a valve gear patented by Mr. D. Joy in 1874. The piston-rod is directly attached to the bellows, but has on it a tappet which reverses the distributing slide valve on the completion of each stroke. This slide valve is of the piston type, but is in reality two valves combined in one, for by its sliding motion the valve acts as the main slide valve, while by a rotary motion through 20 deg. it acts as a plug valve. The plug is in the middle of the length of the piston slide, and by its motion lets the water to and from the ends of the chest of the piston valve, so causing the sliding motion of this valve. The rotation of the valve is performed by two inclined horns, secured to the valve-rod and moved by the tappet on the piston-rod. A simple tappet moving a single slide valve will not work at a very slow speed without assistance, and it is for this reason that some form of auxiliary valve is almost invariably introduced.""], ""other"": [""Inv. 1897-72"", ""1923-503"", ""water-pressure engine""]}","{""object_names"": [""Joy's patent Water Pressure Engine""], ""makers"": [], ""organisations/institutions"": [""Science Museum Group""], ""dates"": [], ""places"": [""London"", ""Greater London"", ""England"", ""United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""Sectional drawing (scale 1:12)""], ""other"": [""framed and glazed"", ""Museum Motive Power drawings"", ""drawings 1923""]}"

Bamford in 1885. The piston-rod is connected directly with the bellows, and water is admitted to either end of the working cylinder by a piston valve. This valve is itself moved by the pressure water which is distributed by a small auxiliary slide valve driven from the piston-rod by a tappet-gear.\nThe engine has a horizontal working cylinder, with the valve chest on top. The main valve consists of four pistons, connected together and sliding in a cylindrical casing which is provided with suitable inlet and exhaust ports. The two inner pistons serve to distribute the pressure water to the end of the working cylinder, the space between them being in communication with the water inlet, while the two outer pistons are packed with cup leathers and work in the closed ends of the casing. These ends serve as cylinders, to which the pressure water is admitted alternately by the auxiliary valve, through ports in the main valve stem, so as to cause the piston valve to move from end to end. The valve stem between the two inner pistons is of rectangular section, and the necessary slide valve is applied to its upper face. Three ports are formed in this face, the outer ports leading to the ends of the main valve and the central one to the exhaust, while side lugs are formed on the auxiliary valve to keep it in place, and to serve as abutments against which the arms of a forked lever bear when moving the valve. This lever is mounted on a shaft which passes through a stuffing-box and has on its outer end a slotted lever connected with a rod which is worked backwards and forwards, through a short distance at each end of the piston stroke, by a tappet-rod fixed to an arm on the piston-rod. The tappets are adjustable so that the valve may be set to reverse the motion without shock.\nWhen the piston nears the end of its stroke, the tappet-gear carries the auxiliary valve in the same direction, thus admitting the pressure water to the opposite end of the piston valve, and driving it in the same direction so as to admit water behind the piston to drive it back.

At Kinneil the engine, although it had a separate condenser (see No. 62) and embodied other improvements, was hardly a success owing to its defective mechanical construction. When Watt joined Boulton the engine and boiler were conveyed from Scotland by water via Hull to Birmingham, and for two years the engine was being rebuilt and improved, until, with a new bored cast-iron cylinder, 2 ft. stroke, it worked fairly well. It was known as \u201cBeelzebub,\u201d and had an 18 in. cylinder, 5 ft. stroke, and worked an 18\u00b75 in. pump against a 24 ft. head. In 1777 it was injured by fire, and \u201cOld Bess\u201d was constructed immediately afterwards; it was, however, of considerably more power, as the steam cylinder is 33 in. diam. with a 7 ft. stroke, and the pump has a diam. of 24 in. Its duty was to pump water from the tail-race back into the head-race of a water-wheel of 24 ft. diam. and 6 ft. breast, at times when the stream flow was insufficient. This indirect method of obtaining rotatory motion by steam power had previously been employed in London and elsewhere. Long after the introduction of the rotative steam engine, however, this method of driving was still practised for textile machinery, owing to the more regular motion that it was considered was obtainable by the intervention of a water-wheel. The power lost must, however, have been considerable, for if the mechanical efficiency of the water-wheel and its gearing was 50 per cent. and that of the pumps 80 per cent., the combined efficiency could only be 40 per cent., which would be only one-half of the mechanical efficiency of a directly rotative engine, so that twice the amount of coal then necessary would be consumed in doing the required work.""], ""other"": [""Plate II., No. 3"", ""Scale 1: 12"", ""Inv. 1894-151, 21, 530, S.M. 229""]}","{""object_names"": [], ""makers"": [], ""organisations/institutions"": [], ""dates"": [], ""places"": [""England"", ""United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""Motive Power models; pumping engines; steam engines; models; pumping engines; steam engines""], ""other"": [""1:12""]}"

The cylinders are mounted on one bedplate, and the front cylinder is connected with the main crankshaft bearing by a girder frame in which the bored crosshead guides are formed. The shaft carries a grooved fly-wheel; a crank disc is fixed to its front end and its rear end is supported on a separate pedestal bearing. The high-pressure cylinder is fitted with double-beat inlet-valves actuated by the variable expansion trip gear patented by Dr. W. R. Proell in 1881. In this arrangement, a horizontal lever, oscillated by an eccentric, has suspended at each end a bell-crank lever; the vertical arms of the bell-cranks have notches at their lower ends, which, in their downward motion, catch upon and depress the ends of short pivoted levers which are connected with the valve spindles. The motion of the rocking lever brings the horizontal arm of the bell-cranks periodically into contact with a horizontal plate, the position of which is controlled by the governor; this causes the notches to slip off the valve levers and allows the valves to close sharply under the action of springs and dash-pots mounted above them. If the speed increases the plate will rise and the valves will close earlier in the stroke. The exhaust-valves are of the \u201cCorliss\u201d type (see No. 135). The low-pressure cylinder has Corliss inlet and exhaust-valves, and the inlet valves have a hand adjusted trip gear of the modified \u201cReynolds\u201d type. A wrist plate, loose on the valve spindle, carries a spring catch, which engages with an arm on the valve spindle; the wrist plate is oscillated by an eccentric and, at a certain point of the motion, the catch is disengaged from the valve arm by a fixed roller, so releasing the valve, which closes under the action of a spring and dash-pot. The positions of the releasing rollers are adjusted by hand. One eccentric serves for all the inlet-valves and another for the exhaust-valves. A Porter governor, provided with a dash-pot for damping out sudden and violent fluctuations, is fitted. The steam pipe between the cylinders forms a receiver, and both cylinders and pipes are lagged with wood. The cylinders are 12 in. and 21 in. diam. by 30 in. stroke; when the engine is supplied with steam at 100 lb. pressure, and is making 110 r.p.m., it develops 136 effective h.p., with economy, or a maximum of 186 indicated h.p. The fly-wheel is 10 ft. diam. and is grooved for five ropes of 1.75 in. diam. The engine is fitted with a jet condenser placed below the floor level, the air and feed pumps being placed beside it and driven by an \""L\"" lever from the tail rod of the low-pressure cylinder.""], ""other"": [""Scale 1: 12"", ""Inv. 1910-31"", ""S.M. 250"", ""S.M. 251"", ""working""]}","{""object_names"": [""Horizontal Tandem Compound Engine""], ""makers"": [""Gilbert, A.""], ""organisations/institutions"": [""Science Museum Group""], ""dates"": [""c. 1910""], ""places"": [""England"", ""United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""Motive Power models"", ""compound steam engines"", ""models""], ""other"": [""Scale 1:12""]}"

When both wheels are of the same diameter the fly-wheel makes twice the number of revolutions that it would if actuated by a crank and connecting-rod, the extra revolution being due to the fact that the planet wheel, although going round in a circle, does not revolve on its own axis.

It was originally designed for use with expansion gears which automatically control the point of cut-off of the steam in the cylinder, but is now used for all types of engines with throttle valve control. The governor consists of a cylindrical casing keyed to the shaft, having at its lower end projecting arms which support the pivots of the two bellcrank levers. The vertical arms of the bellcranks carry the governor balls, while the horizontal arms carry rollers bearing upon the upper flange of a sliding sleeve which surrounds the shaft and is pressed downward by a helical spring contained in the casing; the lower end of the sliding sleeve carries a collar with which the expansion gear is connected. The governor is made as frictionless as possible by the use of ball bearings for the bellcrank pivots, and ball thrust bearings at top and bottom of the sleeve. Cork buffers are provided for the balls to rest upon when at their minimum radius. When working, the balls move nearly horizontally so that gravity has little effect; the vertical compression of the spring is equal to the radial motion of the balls, which makes the governor very sensitive, so that it will move from its full load position to no load with little change of speed.

The period represented by the model is about the middle of that century. At first it was the practice to place the boiler vertically under the engine cylinder, but about 1760, as the power of engines was increasing, the demand for more steam was met by an increase in the number of the boilers, placed in contiguous settings, rather than in their size. The boiler was under-fired and set in masonry or brickwork, so that the hot gases made a complete circuit of the sides on their way to the chimney in a way known as a \u201cwheel draught.\u201d As the pressure used was practically only that of the atmosphere, the question of construction was subsidiary to that of heating surface; accordingly we find that the flange boiler, which was the type used with the earliest Newcomen engines, had the side flue formed by a horizontal flange uniting vertical sides to a base plate. Later a slight improvement was made by adopting conical or concave sides, hence the name \u201chaystack.\u201d The bottom was at one time recessed so as to form a spiral flue, as patented in 1748 by Thomas Stephens and Moses Hadley, but generally it was flat or concave. Internal stays were but rarely used, and instances of boilers up to 15 ft. diam. without them are recorded. The numerous explosions that had been traced to these defects in shape and construction and the low ratio of heating surface to cubic contents possible, led to the disuse of this type of boiler. The material of which the boiler was made was at first copper, often with lead for the top; the corners appear to have been made by flanging the plates. On account of their durability and less cost, wrought-iron plates produced by hammering seem to have been substituted as early as 1725. Cast iron was also used; even in 1776 Smeaton preferred this material for his boilers. It was not till about 1790 that plates and other sections produced by rolling became generally available. The feed water was introduced through a valve controlled by hand into a cistern on a vertical stand-pipe by which a column of water of sufficient height to balance the pressure within was obtained. The water level was indicated by the position of a lever connected with a float inside.

The thermal storage system employed by Mr. Halpin, while depending upon the same principles as these earlier arrangements, forms a somewhat different application. In the method he patented in 1891\u20132, which was primarily designed to overcome the difficulties experienced in electric light stations through the great variations in the work required from the plant at various times, the excess of heat received by the boilers when the engine demand for steam is slight is stored in a reservoir of hot water, suitably lagged with non-conducting covering. The reservoir is a vertical cylindrical vessel 30 ft. high by 8 ft. diam., greater capacity when necessary being secured by increasing the number of such vessels. The boiler and reservoir pressures are higher than that at which the steam is supplied to the engine, and the thermal storage is represented by the difference in the amount of heat in the reservoir at the temperatures corresponding with the higher and lower pressures respectively. With pressures of 250 lb. and 115 lb. absolute it is estimated that each pound of water originally in the reservoir will supply 0.07 lb. of steam at the lower pressure, which steam is thus available to assist the boilers at the time when the engine demand exceeds their supplying capacity; furthermore, water from the reservoir can be directly admitted to the boiler so that the feed can at the same time be shut off. When, moreover, through steam having been withdrawn, the temperature and pressure of the reservoir have fallen, the mass of cooler water it contains is capable of condensing steam from the boiler and thereby storing heat when, through a reduction in the demand, the boilers are supplying more steam than is being required. These lithographs, however, show a modification of the apparatus patented by Mr. Halpin in 1901, in which a storage reservoir or drum is placed on the top of a horizontal boiler and connected with its shell by a tube of large area which extends nearly to the top of the drum, both vessels being at the same pressure. The feed water, from an injector or pump, is introduced at the top of the drum wherein, as it becomes heated nearly to the steam pressure, it deposits its sediment thus saving incrustation in the boiler itself. This hot water, taken from above the sediment level, is afterwards allowed to flow into the boiler as feed when an exceptional load comes on, the injector feed being shut off so as to increase the steaming power.

The valve is of the sluice type, in two parts, one of which provides a free passage for the fluid, whilst the other contains two discs between which is a spring pressing them to the working faces to ensure steam tightness. The mechanism operating the valve is of the usual type, and consists of a hand-wheel, which can rotate only, causing a left-handed screw engaging with it and with the sluice spindle, to rise or fall, thus opening or closing the valve passage.

K. Rider in 1871\u20137. It has two vertical plungers of equal diameter, connected with two overhanging cranks set at right angles on a fly-wheel shaft. The plungers work within two cylindrical chambers, one chamber being kept cool by a water-jacket, and the other being heated from below by a furnace, which, in the model, is replaced by a gas burner. The two chambers are in free communication by a connecting box, which, however, is filled with a number of thin cast-iron plates, so that a large expanse of metal surface is presented to any air passing through the box, which is the regenerator. The stroke of the hot plunger is considerably longer than that of the cold one, so that although the pressures under the plungers are always equal, the volume displaced by the hot plunger is the greater. A constant weight of air is enclosed between the two plungers, but as the crankshaft revolves this arrangement of the cranks is such that during the upward stroke of the hot plunger more of the air is in the hot chamber, and consequently the common pressure is higher than when the plungers are returning. The difference between the power exerted in the upward strokes and that absorbed by the return strokes gives the useful work. In passing through the regenerator the air from the hot chamber leaves some of its heat, which it absorbs again on its return passage, the same air being passed backward and forward continuously, and its pressure rising and falling with each revolution. To replace any loss through leakage a small air valve opening inward is fitted, and through this air enters if at any portion of the cycle the internal pressure falls below that of the atmosphere. A small pump is connected with the cold plunger to maintain the circulation round the cold chamber, and to do useful pumping work when this is required. Such engines run at about 120 rev. per min., and are used where a small motor is required and skilled attendance is not available, the absence of danger of explosion being a valuable feature.""], ""other"": [""Scale 1: 2"", ""Inv. 1887-96"", ""19,604""]}","{""object_names"": [""hot air engine"", ""hot air engine Barbican, City of London, London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom""], ""makers"": [""Hayward-Tyler & Co.

For this reason, and on account of the difficulty of getting the charge in and out of the cylinder in the short time available, this type of engine does not give double the power of a four-stroke engine of the same size, but only about 50 per cent. more at the normal speed, and even less at higher speeds."", ""The mean effective pressure is about 60 lb. per sq. in."", ""A specially compact form of spray carburetter, having a hand-adjusted needle jet, is attached to the crank chamber inlet port, and this is provided with a non-return valve."", ""A heavy fly-wheel is fitted to one end of the crank-shaft and the ignition contact maker is placed behind it; a long lever is pro-vided for varying the point of ignition.""], ""other"": [""VALVELESS TWO-STROKE PETROL MOTOR."", ""Inv. 1913-164, S.M. 441."", ""The engine can be run with paraffin if fitted with a suitable carburetter, and it will run equally well in either direction."", ""It weighs, complete, 70 lb."", ""Presented by the Day Motor Co., Ltd.""]}","{""object_names"": [], ""makers"": [""Day, Joseph""], ""organisations/institutions"": [], ""dates"": [], ""places"": [""London"", ""Greater London"", ""England"", ""United Kingdom""], ""descriptions"": [""Heat Engines (non steam)"", ""two stroke petrol engines"", ""two stroke petrol engines""], ""other"": [""patent nos. 6410 and 9247, dated 1891"", ""Day Two-stroke Valveless Petrol Engine"", ""Day Motor Company Limited""]}"
